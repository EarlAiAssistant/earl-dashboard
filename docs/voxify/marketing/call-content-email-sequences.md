Turn a customer interview into a 1,500-word blog post with:
- H2/H3 structure for SEO

Extract insights from a sales call and turn them into a drip campaign:

- Email 2: Agitate (why it's urgent)
- Email 3: Solution (your product)
- Email 4: Social proof (case study)

- Challenge (before state)

### Email 5: Social Proof (Day 7 - Case study)

**Subject:** How Sarah went from 10 hours to 10 minutes per transcript

**Preview text:** A case study from one of our power users

**Body:**

Hey [First Name],

Meet Sarah. She's a product manager at a Series B SaaS company, and she does 10-15 customer interviews per month.

**Before Call-Content:**
- Spent 10+ hours per transcript writing blog posts, case studies, and emails
- Only published 1 piece of content per month
- Customer insights lived in Google Docs and never saw the light of day

**After Call-Content:**
- Turns transcripts into full content packs in 10 minutes
- Publishes 8-10 pieces of content per month
- Increased organic traffic by 3x in 6 months
- Her CEO asked how she suddenly got so productive

**Sarah's favorite feature?**  
The Brand Voice AI. She uploaded 10 past blog posts, and now every output sounds exactly like her writing style.

"I was skeptical at first—I thought it would sound robotic. But honestly, it's better than my first drafts. I just tweak it 10-20%, and it's ready to publish." — Sarah C., Head of Product Marketing

**Want results like Sarah's?**

You've got 7 days left in your trial. Here's what to do:
1. Upload 3-5 transcripts this week
2. Try the Blog Post and Email Sequence templates
3. Compare your output to your usual workflow

I bet you'll save 20+ hours this week alone.

Best,  
Drew

P.S. Sarah's team just upgraded to the Agency tier ($497/month) because they're processing 50+ transcripts/month. If that's you, reply and I'll set you up with a custom plan.

**Preview text:** Reactivate in the next 7 days and keep your 30% discount

### Trigger 3: At 80% of monthly usage limit

**Subject:** Heads up: You're running low on transcripts

**Body:**

Hey [First Name],

Quick heads-up: **You've used 16 out of 20 transcripts this month** (80%).

**What happens when you hit your limit?**

You'll get a 10% grace buffer (2 extra transcripts), but after that, you'll need to:
1. **Upgrade to the next tier** (instant, prorated)
2. **Buy a Booster Pack** (+10 transcripts for $97)

**Want to avoid hitting the limit?**

Upgrade now and get unlimited usage for the rest of the month:  
→ [Upgrade to Professional ($197/month)]

Questions? Hit reply.

Best,  
Drew

### Trigger 4: Hit 100% usage limit

**Subject:** You've hit your monthly limit—here's what to do

**Body:**

Hey [First Name],

You've used all **20 transcripts** this month. Great work—you're clearly getting value!

**Here are your options:**

1. **Upgrade to Professional** (50 transcripts/month)  
   → [Upgrade Now - $197/month]

2. **Buy a Booster Pack** (+10 transcripts for $97, one-time)  
   → [Buy Booster Pack]

3. **Wait until next month** (your limit resets on [Date])

**Why upgrade?**

If you're processing 20+ transcripts/month, you're saving 160+ hours. That's $24,000 in opportunity cost (at $150/hour). The Professional tier at $197/month is a no-brainer ROI.

Let me know what works best.

Best,  
Drew

P.S. If you're on the fence, reply and I'll set up a call to find the right plan for you.

### Trigger 5: User invited team member (upsell to Agency tier)

**Subject:** Your team is growing! Consider upgrading to Agency

**Body:**

Hey [First Name],

I noticed you invited [Team Member Name] to Call-Content. That's awesome—collaboration is where this tool really shines.

**Quick question:** Are you planning to add more team members?

If so, you might want to check out the **Agency tier**:
- **10 team seats** (vs. 3 on Professional)
- **150 transcripts/month** (vs. 50)
- **Custom templates** (built for your specific workflow)
- **Priority support** (we respond in <2 hours)

**Same price per person, way more value:**
- Professional: $197/month ÷ 3 people = **$65/person**
- Agency: $497/month ÷ 10 people = **$50/person**

If you're adding 4+ people, Agency is actually cheaper.

Want to chat about it? Reply and I'll help you figure out the best plan.

Best,  
Drew

### Trigger 6: Subscription canceled (win-back email)

**Subject:** Sorry to see you go—can I ask why?

**Body:**

Hey [First Name],

I noticed you canceled your subscription. No hard feelings—but I'm curious: **what made you cancel?**

Was it:
- Budget?
- Features?
- Quality of output?
- You just didn't use it enough?

**Reply and let me know.** Your feedback helps me make Call-Content better for everyone.

**Also, here's an offer:**

If you come back in the next 30 days, I'll give you **50% off for 3 months**—no strings attached.

That's:
- Starter: $49/month (normally $99)
- Professional: $98/month (normally $197)
- Agency: $248/month (normally $497)

Just reply to this email and I'll set it up.

Best,  
Drew

P.S. If Call-Content wasn't the right fit, I totally get it. Thanks for trying it, and I hope we can work together again someday.

### Trigger 7: High-value user (processed 30+ transcripts in a month)

**Body:**

Hey [First Name],

Wow—you've processed **[X] transcripts this month**. You're officially a power user. 🔥
