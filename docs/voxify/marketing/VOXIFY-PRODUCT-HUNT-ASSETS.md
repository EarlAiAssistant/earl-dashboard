## First Comment (As Maker)

Post this immediately after launch:

```
Hey Product Hunt! 👋

I'm Drew, founder of Voxify.

Here's the problem I kept running into: I'd have amazing customer calls—they'd share their struggles, their wins, quotable insights—and then... nothing. The recordings would sit in a folder, never becoming content.

Sound familiar?

The issue wasn't motivation. It was friction. Turning a 30-minute call into usable marketing content took 3-4 hours.

So I built Voxify.

**How it works:**
1. Upload a customer call transcript
2. Click generate
3. Get website copy, email drafts, social posts, and FAQs
4. All using your customers' actual words

**What makes it different from ChatGPT:**
- No prompt engineering required
- Purpose-built for customer conversations
- Consistent output structure
- 60 seconds instead of 60 minutes

I'd love your feedback. Try it with a real transcript and let me know what you think!

Happy to answer any questions. 🙏

### LinkedIn (Schedule for 6 AM PT)

```
Just launched Voxify on Product Hunt! 🎉

Here's the problem I kept running into:

Amazing customer calls → insights shared → recordings sit in a folder → content never gets created.

The friction was too high. 3-4 hours to turn one call into usable content.

So I built something to fix it.

Voxify: Upload a transcript, get website copy, email drafts, social posts, and FAQs in 60 seconds.

All using your customers' actual words—not generic AI speak.

If you have customer calls that could become content (but never do), I built this for you.

Would mean a lot if you checked it out:

## FAQ for Product Hunt Comments

**Q: How is this different from just using ChatGPT?**
> ChatGPT requires prompt engineering for each output type. Voxify is purpose-built for customer transcripts—one upload, all content types, 60 seconds. No prompting required.

**Q: What AI model do you use?**
> We use Claude (by Anthropic) for content generation. It's excellent at preserving voice and extracting meaningful quotes.

**Q: Is there an API?**
> Not yet, but it's on our roadmap! If you're interested in API access, shoot me an email at drew@getvoxify.com.

**Q: How do you handle privacy?**
> Your transcripts are never used for AI training. Data is encrypted and you can delete it anytime. Full privacy policy on our website.

**Q: What if I don't have transcripts?**
> Most video tools (Zoom, Meet, Teams) auto-generate transcripts. You can also use Otter.ai or Fathom to get transcripts easily.

**Q: Can teams use this?**
> Yes! Professional and Business plans include team features with multiple seats and shared content libraries.
