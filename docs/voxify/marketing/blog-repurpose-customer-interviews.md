You did a customer interview last week.

You got the transcript.

You wrote a case study.

And now... what? You're done with that interview, right?

**Wrong.**

That single interview is a goldmine. You can create **12+ pieces of content** from it—enough to fill your marketing calendar for a month.

This guide shows you exactly how.

## Why Repurposing Matters

Most companies do customer interviews and create **one** thing from them (usually a case study).

That's like buying groceries and only making one meal. Wasteful.

Here's what you should be doing:

**One customer interview → 12+ marketing assets:**
1. Case study (website)
2. Testimonials (3 versions)
3. LinkedIn post
4. Twitter thread
5. Email nurture sequence (3 emails)
6. Sales one-pager
7. FAQ section
8. Blog post
9. Pain points summary
10. Objections + responses
11. Feature requests
12. Pull quote graphics

**One interview. One month of content.**

## The 12 Content Types (And How to Create Them)

### 1. Case Study (800-1,200 words)

**What it is:** A detailed success story showing how the customer used your product to achieve results.

**Structure:**

- The results (specific metrics)
- Pull quote

**Where to use it:**
- Dedicated case studies page on your website
- Sales proposals
- Email attachments

**Time to create:**
- Manual: 2-3 hours
- With AI: 10-15 minutes

**Example:**

### 2. Testimonials (3 Versions: Short, Medium, Long)

**What it is:** Direct quotes from the customer, optimized for different contexts.

**Short (1 sentence):**

**Medium (2-3 sentences):**
> "Before [Product], we spent 15 hours/week on client reports. Now it takes 2 hours. We reinvested that time into strategy calls and closed 3 new clients this quarter. Game-changer." — Sarah M.

**Long (4-5 sentences):**
> "Honestly, I was skeptical. We'd tried automation tools before. But [Product] actually works. What used to take 15 hours now takes 2. We used that extra time to deepen client relationships—and it directly led to $180k in new business. Best investment we've made." — Sarah M.

That's what happened when we switched to [Product].

Before: 15 hours/week on manual client reports
After: 2 hours/week (automated)

The 13 hours saved? We spent them on strategy calls. That led to 3 new retainer deals.

Sometimes the best growth strategy is just... getting your time back.
```

**Where to use it:**
- Your company LinkedIn page

### 4. Twitter/X Thread (5-7 tweets)

**What it is:** Story-driven thread that pulls people in with the result, then explains the journey.

**Structure:**
```
🧵 We saved 13 hours/week by automating one thing.

Here's what we did (and how it led to $180k in new business): (1/7)

---

The old way:
✅ Spend 15 hours/week creating client reports
😰 Pull data from 5 different tools
😰 Copy-paste into spreadsheets
😰 Format in PowerPoint
😰 Send manually every Friday

Total time: Soul-crushing. (2/7)

---

The problem? Those 15 hours could be spent on:
• Strategy calls
• Content creation
• Business development

But the reports had to get done. (3/7)

---

Then we found [Product].

Uploaded client data → Generated professional report in 10 minutes.

"Wait, what?" was my literal reaction. (4/7)

---

Implementation: 1 week.

Results:
• 15 hours/week → 2 hours/week
• 13 hours saved per week = 52 hours/month
• Used extra time for client strategy calls (5/7)

---

3 months later: 3 new retainer clients.

Annual value: $180k.

Time investment to get them: The 52 hours/month we got back.

ROI: Priceless. (6/7)

---

If you're doing the work but not capturing the ROI...

You're leaving money on the table.

**Email 1: Introduce the problem (send on Day 3 of trial)**
```
Subject: Are you spending 15 hours/week on reports?

Hi [Name],

Quick question: How much time do you spend creating client reports each week?

For Sarah (a marketing consultant), it was 15 hours. Every Friday afternoon, she'd pull data from Google Analytics, Facebook Ads, and her CRM, then manually compile everything into PowerPoint.

"It was soul-crushing work," she told us.

Sound familiar?

If you're stuck in the same cycle, here's what Sarah did to get her Fridays back:

Best,
[Your name]
```

**Email 2: Show the solution (send on Day 7)**
```
Subject: How Sarah saved 13 hours/week

Hi [Name],

Last week I told you about Sarah—the consultant spending 15 hours/week on client reports.

Here's what she did:

She automated it with [Product].

Now her reports generate automatically every Monday morning. No manual work. No copy-paste. No Friday afternoon dread.

Time saved: 13 hours/week.

What did she do with that time? Strategy calls with clients.

Result: 3 new retainer deals worth $180k/year.

Want the same results? [Start your trial]

Best,
[Your name]
```

**Email 3: Social proof (send on Day 10)**
```
Subject: "This tool saved us $180k"

Hi [Name],

I'll let Sarah say it:

"I calculated it once: the time I save with [Product] is worth about $8,000 per month to my business. And I'm paying $47. It's not even close."

That's a 170x ROI.

If you're still manually creating reports, what's it costing you?

## Common Mistakes

**Wrong:** Interview → case study → done  
**Right:** Interview → 12 assets → full month of content

**Fix:** Use this checklist. Extract every ounce of value.

**Fix:** Schedule in advance. One interview = one month.

**Right:** Optimize for each platform

**Fix:**

- Instagram: Visual-first, quote graphics

---

### Mistake 4: Not Tracking Performance
**Wrong:** Publish and forget  
**Right:** Track what works, double down

**Fix:** Monitor:

Do more of what works.
