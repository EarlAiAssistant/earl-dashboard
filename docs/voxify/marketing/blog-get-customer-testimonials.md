## Why Customers Don't Give Testimonials (And How to Fix It)

**The problem:** You email 20 customers asking for testimonials. You get 2 responses.

**Why this happens:**

### Reason 1: You're Asking Too Much
"Can you write a testimonial?" sounds like homework.

**Fix:** Make it easy. Draft it for them based on what they've already said.

### Reason 2: They Don't Know What to Say
Blank page = paralysis.

**Fix:** Ask specific questions instead of asking for a "testimonial."

### Reason 3: No Immediate Benefit to Them
"Help us with marketing" isn't compelling.

**Fix:** Offer something in return (exposure, discount, feature request priority).

### Reason 4: Bad Timing
Asking 1 day after signup? Too soon. 6 months later? They forgot.

**Fix:** Ask right after a "wow" moment.

## Method 1: The Interview → Transcript → Quote Method

**How it works:**
1. Schedule a customer interview
2. Record the call
3. Pull quotes directly from the transcript
4. Send for approval

**Why it works:** They already gave you the testimonial. You just wrote it down.

### Step-by-Step:

**1. Schedule the interview**
> "Hey [Name], would you be open to a quick 20-minute call? I'd love to hear about your experience with [Product]."

**2. During the call, listen for quotable moments**
When they say things like:
- "This saved us 10 hours/week"
- "We closed $50k in new business"
- "I wish we'd found this sooner"

Make a note: ⭐ QUOTE

**3. After the call, pull the best quotes**
Short version (1 sentence):
> "This tool saved us 13 hours a week."

Medium version (2-3 sentences):
> "Before [Product], we spent 15 hours/week on reports. Now it takes 2. We reinvested that time and closed 3 new clients."

Long version (4-5 sentences):
> "Honestly, I was skeptical. We'd tried other tools. But [Product] works. What used to take 15 hours now takes 2. We used that time to close $180k in new business."

**4. Send for approval**
> "Hey [Name], thanks again for the call! I pulled a few quotes from our conversation. Would you be comfortable with me using these as testimonials?
>
> [Quote 1]
> [Quote 2]
> [Quote 3]
>
> Feel free to edit or veto any of them. Let me know!"

**Approval rate:** 80-90%

**Time:** 30 minutes (after interview)

---

## Method 2: The Post-Win Email Method

**How it works:** Catch them right after they achieve a result with your product.

**Trigger moments:**
- They upgrade to a higher plan
- They refer a friend
- They leave a 5-star review
- They tweet about your product
- They achieve a milestone (e.g., "You've processed 1,000 transactions!")

### Email Template:

**Subject:** "Can I quote you on that? 😊"

**Body:**
> Hi [Name],
>
> I saw you [upgraded / referred a friend / left a review / tweeted]. That made my day!
>
> You said: "[Quote from their review/tweet/message]"
>
> Would you be okay with me using this as a testimonial on our website? I think it'd really help other [type of customer] understand how [Product] can help them.
>
> If yes, I just need:
> - Your permission
> - How you'd like to be credited (e.g., "Sarah M., Consultant" or full name + company)
> - (Optional) A headshot if you're comfortable
>
> And as a thank you, I'm upgrading your account to [next tier] for the next 3 months. Enjoy!
>
> Thanks,
> [Your name]

**Why it works:**
- They're in a positive mood (just got a win)
- You're quoting them, not asking them to write
- You're giving something in return

**Response rate:** 60-70%

---

## Method 3: The Survey → Testimonial Method

**How it works:** Bury testimonial request in a customer satisfaction survey.

### Survey Questions:

**Question 1:** "How satisfied are you with [Product]?"
- Very satisfied
- Satisfied
- Neutral
- Unsatisfied

**Question 2:** "What's the biggest benefit you've gotten from [Product]?"
- [Open text field]

**Question 3:** "Would you recommend [Product] to a colleague?"
- Yes
- Maybe
- No

**Question 4:** "If yes, what would you tell them?"
- [Open text field] ← This is your testimonial

**Question 5:** "Can we use your response as a testimonial?"
- Yes, with my name
- Yes, but anonymously
- No

**Why it works:** They're already answering questions. Adding one more is easy.

**Tools:** Typeform, Google Forms, SurveyMonkey

**Response rate:** 30-40% (lower, but scales better)

---

## Method 4: The Case Study → Testimonial Method

**How it works:** Write a case study, pull the best quotes.

### Process:

**1. Find a customer with great results**
Look for:
- Power users (use product daily)
- Recent wins (achieved measurable results)
- Willing to share publicly

**2. Interview them**
Ask:
- What problem were you facing?
- How did you use our product?
- What results did you achieve?

**3. Write the case study**
Include 2-3 pull quotes throughout.

**4. Send for approval**
> "Hey [Name], I wrote up your story as a case study (attached). Can I publish this? Also, can I pull a few quotes to use separately as testimonials?"

**5. Extract testimonials**
Pull the best 1-2 sentences from the case study.

**Why it works:** You're creating value for them (case study = exposure) while getting testimonials.

**Time:** 2-3 hours (but you get case study + testimonials)

---

## Method 5: The Social Media Scrape Method

**How it works:** Find people already praising you publicly.

### Where to look:

**Twitter:**
- Search: "[Your product] saved"
- Search: "love [Your product]"
- Monitor mentions of your brand

**LinkedIn:**
- Search for your product name
- Check tagged posts

**Reddit:**
- Search your product name in relevant subreddits
- Check r/SaaS, r/Entrepreneur, niche communities

**Review sites:**
- G2, Capterra, TrustPilot
- App Store reviews

### How to turn it into a testimonial:

**1. Find a great tweet/post**
> "@YourProduct just saved me 10 hours this week. Best $50/month I spend."

**2. Ask permission**
> "Hey [Name], love this! Would you be okay with us using this as a testimonial on our website? Happy to link to your profile/company."

**3. Format it properly**
> "Just saved me 10 hours this week. Best $50/month I spend."  
> — [Name], [Title from their bio]

**Why it works:** They already said it publicly. You're just amplifying it.

**Approval rate:** 90%+ (they already shared it publicly)

---

## Method 6: The "Review for Reward" Method

**How it works:** Incentivize testimonials with rewards.

**Rewards that work:**
- Account upgrades (free 3 months at next tier)
- Feature request priority
- Early access to new features
- Discounts on annual plans
- Swag (if they care)

### Email Template:

**Subject:** "Share your experience, get 3 months free"

**Body:**
> Hi [Name],
>
> Quick ask: We're collecting testimonials from customers like you who've had great results with [Product].
>
> If you're willing to share your experience (2-3 sentences is perfect), I'll upgrade your account to [next tier] for the next 3 months—on us.
>
> Just reply with:
> 1. What problem [Product] solved for you
> 2. What results you've achieved
> 3. Your preferred attribution (name, title, company)
>
> Sound good?
>
> Thanks,
> [Your name]

**Why it works:** Clear value exchange (testimonial = reward).

**Response rate:** 40-50%

**Important:** Make sure the reward doesn't violate platform policies (e.g., paying for reviews is banned on some sites).

## Method 7: The Video Testimonial Method

**How it works:** Ask customers to record a quick video.

**Why video?**
- More authentic than text
- Shows real person (builds trust)
- Can be transcribed into text testimonials

### How to request:

**Option A: DIY (customer records)**
> "Hey [Name], would you be willing to record a quick 30-second video about your experience with [Product]? Just answer these questions:
>
> 1. What problem were you facing?
> 2. How did [Product] help?
> 3. What results have you seen?
>
> Record on your phone, no editing needed. We'll handle the rest!"

**Option B: Scheduled (you record)**
> "Hey [Name], would you be open to a quick 5-minute Zoom call where I ask you a few questions about [Product]? We'll record it and use clips as testimonials."

**Why it works:** 
- Video feels more personal
- Lower barrier (talking > writing)
- You get both video + text (transcript)

**Tools:** 
- Loom (for self-recorded)
- Zoom (for scheduled)
- Testimonial.to (automated video collection)

**Response rate:** 20-30% (lower, but high-impact)

## When to Ask for Testimonials

**Best times:**

### 1. Right After a "Wow" Moment
- They just achieved a result
- They just upgraded
- They just referred someone
- They just left a positive review elsewhere

**Why:** Peak satisfaction = willing to help

---

### 2. After 30-60 Days of Use
- Long enough to see results
- Short enough to remember onboarding

**Why:** Sweet spot between "too new" and "forgot why they signed up"

---

### 3. Before Renewal
- Annual customers approaching renewal
- Monthly customers at 11 months

**Why:** They're evaluating value anyway. If they renew, they're happy.

---

### 4. After Customer Support Win
- You solved a problem fast
- You went above and beyond
- They thanked your support team

**Why:** Gratitude = willingness to reciprocate

---

## Worst times:

❌ 1 day after signup (too soon)  
❌ During onboarding struggles (bad timing)  
❌ Right after a bug/outage (negative mood)  
❌ 6+ months of silence (they forgot)

---

## How to Write Testimonial Requests

**Bad request:**
> "Hey, can you write us a testimonial?"

**Good request:**
> "Hey [Name], I noticed you [specific action]. Would you be comfortable sharing what [Product] has helped you achieve? Even 1-2 sentences would be amazing. Happy to draft something based on your feedback if that's easier!"

**What makes it good:**
- Personal (noticed specific action)
- Easy (1-2 sentences)
- Helpful offer (draft for them)

---

## Testimonial Request Email Template

**Subject:** "Quick favor: 2-minute testimonial?"

**Body:**
> Hi [Name],
>
> I noticed you've been using [Product] for [X time] and [specific achievement/action].
>
> Would you be open to sharing your experience? Just a few sentences about:
> 1. What problem you were facing
> 2. How [Product] helped
> 3. What results you've seen
>
> Or if that's easier, I can draft something based on [feedback you gave / conversation we had] and send it for your approval?
>
> Either way, let me know! And thanks for being an awesome customer.
>
> Best,
> [Your name]
>
> P.S. As a thank you, I'll upgrade you to [next tier] for 3 months.

## How to Get Better Testimonials

**Instead of:** "Can you write a testimonial?"

**Ask:**
1. "What problem were you facing before using [Product]?"
2. "How much time/money has it saved you?"
3. "What would you tell a colleague considering [Product]?"

**Why:** Specific questions = specific answers (which make better testimonials).

---
