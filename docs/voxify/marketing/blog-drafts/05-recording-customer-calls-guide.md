# Recording Customer Calls: Tools, Ethics, and Best Practices

*Everything you need to know about capturing customer conversations legally and effectively.*

---

Before you can turn customer calls into content, you need to record them.

Sounds simple, but there are real questions: What tools work best? What's legal? How do you ask for permission without making it awkward?

This guide covers everything you need to know.

## Why Record Customer Calls?

Let's start with the why:

**1. You miss 80% of what's said**

During a conversation, you're listening, responding, thinking about the next question. Even with notes, you miss most of it. Recording captures everything.

**2. Customer language is gold**

The exact words your customers use to describe their problems are marketing gold. You can't reproduce that from memory.

**3. One conversation, endless content**

A single 30-minute call can generate:
- Case study
- Blog post
- 5-10 social posts
- Email copy
- FAQ content
- Sales talking points

Without a recording, you get none of this.

**4. Share insights across your team**

Sales, marketing, product—everyone benefits from hearing real customer voices. Recordings let you share without requiring everyone to be on every call.

## The Legal Stuff (Important)

Before recording anything, understand the legal landscape.

### One-Party vs. Two-Party Consent

In the US, recording laws vary by state:

**One-party consent states** (38 states): Only one person on the call needs to know about the recording. That person can be you.

**Two-party (all-party) consent states** (12 states): Everyone on the call must consent. These include: California, Connecticut, Florida, Illinois, Maryland, Massachusetts, Michigan, Montana, Nevada, New Hampshire, Pennsylvania, and Washington.

**If you're calling across state lines**, the stricter law typically applies. When in doubt, get consent.

### The Simple Solution: Always Ask

Regardless of legal requirements, **always get verbal permission** to record:

- It's ethically right
- It builds trust
- It avoids any legal ambiguity
- Most people say yes

### How to Ask (Without Being Awkward)

The key is to make it casual and explain the benefit:

**Simple ask:**
> "Hey, do you mind if I record this? I want to make sure I don't miss anything important. The recording is just for my notes."

**With benefit to them:**
> "Would it be okay if I record this? That way I can focus on our conversation instead of taking notes, and I can make sure I capture your feedback accurately."

**For marketing use:**
> "I'd love to record this, and if you say anything brilliant—which I'm sure you will—I might want to quote you in a case study. Would that be okay?"

**If they hesitate:**
> "No pressure at all. I can just take notes instead. Whatever you're comfortable with."

In my experience, 95%+ of people say yes when you ask casually and explain why.

**Cons:** Setup required, some apps are unreliable

### External Recorders

Sometimes low-tech is best:

**Voice Recorder App + Speakerphone:**
- Put call on speaker
- Record with phone's voice memo app
- Simple, always works

**Dedicated Voice Recorder:**
- Zoom H1n or similar ($100-200)
- Great audio quality
- Reliable, no app issues
- Good for in-person meetings too

**Pros:** Simple, reliable, no monthly fees
**Cons:** Manual process, extra step to transcribe

## Getting Good Audio Quality

Bad audio = bad transcription = missed insights.

**For video calls:**
- Use a decent microphone (even cheap earbuds help)
- Find a quiet space
- Close other browser tabs (reduces lag/artifacts)
- Ask the other person to find a quiet space too

**For phone calls:**
- Use wired headphones with microphone
- Avoid Bluetooth (can introduce quality issues)
- Step away from background noise
- Consider a dedicated phone for important calls

**For in-person:**
- Position recorder between speakers
- Avoid rooms with echo
- External mic improves quality significantly
- Test before important conversations

## After Recording: Transcription

You have the recording. Now you need text.

### Automatic Transcription

Most modern tools include transcription:

| Tool | Accuracy | Speaker ID | Cost |
|------|----------|------------|------|
| Zoom (auto) | ~90% | Yes | Included in paid plans |
| Otter.ai | ~95% | Yes | $17/month |
| Fathom | ~93% | Yes | Free tier available |
| Rev (human) | ~99% | Yes | $1.50/minute |
| AssemblyAI | ~95% | Yes | $0.37/minute |

### DIY Transcription

If you're on a budget:

1. Upload audio to **Descript** (free trial)
2. Use **YouTube** (upload as private video, auto-captions)
3. Use **MacWhisper** (one-time purchase, uses OpenAI Whisper)
4. Manual transcription (not recommended, extremely time-consuming)

### Cleaning Up Transcripts

Automatic transcripts aren't perfect. Quick fixes:

- Fix obvious misheard words
- Add paragraph breaks for readability
- Label speakers clearly (if not auto-detected)
- Don't over-edit—keep their natural language

### Privacy & Ethics

- Only use recordings for stated purpose

## Call Types Worth Recording

Not every call needs recording. Focus on these high-value conversations:

**Always record:**
- Customer interviews (market research)
- Customer success stories (case studies)
- Sales discovery calls (learn objections)
- Onboarding calls (learn friction points)
- Churn calls (learn why people leave)

**Consider recording:**
- Support calls (identify common issues)
- Product feedback sessions
- Partnership discussions
- Advisory calls

**Probably skip:**
- Internal team meetings (different use case)
- Quick scheduling/admin calls
- Sensitive HR conversations

## From Recording to Content

Once you have your transcript, you're sitting on a content goldmine:

**Quick extraction (manual):**
1. Read through transcript
2. Highlight quotable moments
3. Note key pain points and results
4. Write content using their language

**Fast extraction (with tools):**
1. Upload transcript to Voxify
2. Get website copy, emails, social posts, FAQs automatically
3. Review and refine
4. Publish

Either way, one recorded call can generate weeks of content.

---

## Summary

Recording customer calls isn't complicated:

1. **Pick a tool** — Zoom's built-in recording works for most people
2. **Get permission** — A casual ask at the start of the call
3. **Record** — Hit the button, verify it's working
4. **Transcribe** — Use automatic transcription
5. **Extract value** — Turn conversations into content

The hard part isn't the technical setup. It's remembering to do it consistently.

Start with your next customer call. Get permission, hit record, see what happens.
