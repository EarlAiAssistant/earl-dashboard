## Thread 1: The Problem → Solution Story

```
🧵 I used to waste 90% of my customer calls.

Here's how I fixed it (and how you can too):

---

1/ Every week I'd have 3-4 amazing customer conversations.

They'd share problems, wins, and quotable insights.

Then I'd hang up... and do nothing with it.

Sound familiar?

---

2/ The recording would sit in a folder.

I'd "plan" to extract the good stuff later.

Later = never.

Months of content gold, just sitting there unused.

---

3/ The problem wasn't motivation.

It was friction.

Turning a 30-minute call into usable content took:
- Transcription: 30 min
- Highlighting quotes: 30 min
- Writing content: 1-2 hours

Who has time for that?

---

4/ So I built a system.

Upload a transcript.
Get website copy, emails, social posts, FAQs.
60 seconds.

No prompts. No copy-paste. Just output.

---

5/ Now one customer call generates:
- 5 website sections
- 3 email drafts
- 5 social posts
- 8 FAQ answers

In the time it takes to make coffee.

---

6/ The tool is called Voxify.

If you have customer calls collecting dust, check it out:

7/ What's your content extraction process?

Reply with your approach. I'll share the best ones.

## Thread 2: The Tactical Breakdown

```
🧵 How to turn ONE customer call into 20+ pieces of content:

(A tactical breakdown)

---

1/ First: Record everything.

Get permission at the start:
"Mind if I record this? Want to make sure I don't miss anything."

95% of people say yes.

---

2/ During the call, listen for 4 things:

- Pain quotes ("I was struggling with...")
- Result quotes ("Now I can...")
- Decision quotes ("What convinced me was...")
- Colorful language (anything memorable)

---

3/ Get the transcript.

Most video tools (Zoom, Meet) do this automatically.

If not: Otter, Descript, or just YouTube (upload as private → auto-captions).

---

4/ Now the extraction.

Option A: Manual (takes 1-2 hours)
Option B: AI tools like Voxify (takes 60 seconds)

Either works. One is faster.

---

5/ From one transcript, you can create:

Website Copy:
- Hero headline using their pain language
- Feature descriptions from benefits they mentioned
- Social proof from their results

---

6/ Email Content:
- Welcome email highlighting common pain
- Nurture email sharing a customer story
- Sales email addressing objections they raised

---

7/ Social Posts:
- Quote graphics from their best lines
- Story posts from their journey
- Tips extracted from their experience

---

8/ FAQ/Sales Content:
- Objection handling from "what almost stopped you"
- Competitive positioning from "what else you considered"
- ROI talking points from their results

---

9/ That's 20+ pieces from one conversation.

Do this for every customer call, and you'll never run out of content.

The calls are already happening. Stop wasting them.

---

10/ Want the lazy version?

Voxify does the extraction automatically.

## Thread 3: The Counterintuitive Insight

```
🧵 Controversial take: Your customers write better marketing copy than any copywriter.

Here's why (and how to use it):

---

1/ When a customer says:

"I was drowning in spreadsheets"

That's better than:

"Streamline your data management"

The first is real. The second is marketing speak.

---

2/ Customers describe problems using the exact words your prospects think in.

They're not trying to sound professional.
They're just being honest.

That honesty converts.

---

3/ When you hire a copywriter, here's what happens:

You: "Customers say they're 'drowning in spreadsheets'"
Copywriter: "Got it. How about 'Optimize your workflow'?"

The translation kills the magic.

---

4/ The best marketing doesn't come from writing.

It comes from listening.

Then copying.

(With permission, obviously)

---

5/ Here's the process:

1. Record customer calls
2. Find the gold quotes
3. Use them directly in your marketing
4. Credit the customer if public-facing

That's it.

---

6/ Real example:

Customer quote: "I used to spend 4 hours on case studies. Now it takes 30 minutes."

That's a headline.
That's an ad.
That's social proof.

All from listening.

---

7/ Tools that help with this:

- Recording: Zoom, Fathom, Otter
- Extraction: Voxify (shameless plug, it's what we built)
- Storage: Notion, Airtable, whatever

The tool matters less than the habit.

---

8/ This week: Record one customer call.

Find one quote you can use.

Put it in your marketing.

See what happens.

## Thread 4: The How-I-Built-It Story

```
🧵 I built Voxify because I was wasting 4 hours/week on something that should take 10 minutes.

Here's the story:

---

1/ I used to do customer interviews weekly.

30-45 minute calls with users.

Incredible insights every time.

---

2/ After each call, I'd think:

"That should be a case study"
"That quote should be on the homepage"
"That objection should be in our FAQ"

---

3/ But turning a transcript into content took forever.

- Read through the whole thing
- Highlight the good parts
- Figure out what goes where
- Write each piece separately

2-3 hours, minimum.

---

4/ So most calls went to waste.

They'd sit in a folder.
I'd "get to it later."
Later = never.

---

5/ One day I did the math:

50+ customer calls over 2 years.
Maybe 5 turned into actual content.

45 conversations. Wasted.

---

6/ That's when I started building Voxify.

The idea was simple:
Upload a transcript.
Get ready-to-use content.
No manual extraction.

---

7/ Now one call generates:
- Website copy
- Email drafts
- Social posts
- FAQ answers

In about 60 seconds.

---

8/ We're still early, but the pattern is clear:

When extraction is easy, people actually do it.
When it's hard, they don't.

Remove the friction, capture the value.

---

9/ If you're sitting on customer calls that never became content:

I built Voxify for you.

10/ What's your content extraction process?

Do you have one? Or do calls go to the folder-of-forgotten-dreams?

## Thread 5: The Tactical Tips List

```
🧵 10 customer interview questions that generate quotable marketing content:

(These work every time)

---

1/ "Walk me through your week before you found us."

Gets you: Detailed pain points in their language

Use for: Homepage copy, ad hooks

---

2/ "What was the moment you realized you needed to change something?"

Gets you: The trigger event

Use for: Ad creative, email openers

---

3/ "What almost stopped you from signing up?"

Gets you: Real objections

Use for: FAQ, sales enablement

---

4/ "What did you try before that didn't work?"

Gets you: Competitive intelligence

Use for: Comparison pages, differentiation

---

5/ "How much time/money were you losing to this problem?"

Gets you: Quantifiable pain

Use for: ROI calculators, case studies

---

6/ "What's different now compared to before?"

Gets you: Transformation story

Use for: Case studies, testimonials

---

7/ "Can you give me specific results? Any numbers?"

Gets you: Proof points

Use for: Social proof, sales decks

---

8/ "What would you tell someone on the fence about trying us?"

Gets you: Peer-to-peer messaging

Use for: Testimonials, ads

---

9/ "If we disappeared tomorrow, what would you miss most?"

Gets you: Core value identification

Use for: Positioning, messaging

---

10/ "How would you describe us to a friend?"

Gets you: Their language, not yours

Use for: Taglines, elevator pitch

---

Bonus: Always ask "Can you tell me more about that?" after anything interesting.

The gold is usually 2-3 questions deep.

---

Save this list. Use it in your next customer call.

You'll walk away with weeks of content.

## Thread 6: The Myth Buster

```
🧵 "ChatGPT can turn my transcripts into content"

Yes, but here's what nobody tells you:

---

1/ ChatGPT CAN turn transcripts into content.

I've done it. It works.

Kind of.

---

2/ Here's the process:

1. Copy 5,000-word transcript
2. Paste into ChatGPT
3. Write a prompt
4. Get output
5. Realize it's too generic
6. Write a better prompt
7. Get better output
8. Realize it missed the best quotes
9. Ask for specific sections
10. Format manually
11. Repeat for emails, social, FAQ...

---

3/ Time spent: 30-45 minutes

And that's if you're good at prompting.

Most people: 1-2 hours of frustration.

---

4/ The problem isn't the AI.

It's the workflow.

ChatGPT is a general-purpose tool. It doesn't know what you're trying to extract.

---

5/ So you have to tell it. Every time.

"Find the pain points"
"Now the results"
"Now make it a headline"
"Now an email"
"Now social posts"

Prompt after prompt after prompt.

---

6/ A purpose-built tool is different.

Upload transcript.
It knows what to look for.
It knows the output format.
One click.

---

7/ It's the difference between:

- Spreadsheet vs. purpose-built accounting software
- Word doc vs. notion
- Generic AI vs. specialized workflow

General tools can do anything.
Specialized tools do one thing well.

---

8/ If you have 1 transcript per month: ChatGPT is fine.

If you have 4+: you need a system.

That's why I built Voxify.

---

9/ What tools do you use to extract content from calls?

Curious what's working for people.

## Quick Tips for Twitter/X

1. **First tweet is the hook** — Make it stop the scroll
2. **Use numbers** — "10 questions" beats "some questions"
3. **One idea per tweet** — Don't cram too much
4. **End with engagement** — Ask a question or invite replies
5. **Post threads mid-morning** — 9-11am often works well
6. **Retweet your first tweet** — Gives it a second push
7. **Save threads as drafts** — Write in batches, post over time

---

*Pick one thread. Post it this week. See what resonates.*
