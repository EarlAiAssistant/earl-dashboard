# Blog Post Distribution Channels for Voxify

*Where to share content for maximum reach*

---

## Tier 1: High-Impact, Do Every Time

These channels should be part of your distribution checklist for every blog post.

### LinkedIn (Personal Profile)

**Why:** Your personal network + algorithm favors native content
**How:** 
- Don't just link-drop—write a 200-300 word post that stands alone
- Include the key insight from the blog post
- Add "Link in comments" to boost engagement
- Post mid-week (Tue-Thu), morning or lunch hour

**Template:**
```
[Hook that stands alone]

[2-3 key insights from the post]

[Personal take or story]

I wrote more about this here: [link in first comment]
```

### Twitter/X

**Why:** Reach beyond your network, hashtag discovery
**How:**
- Create a 5-7 tweet thread summarizing the post
- First tweet should work standalone
- Last tweet links to full article
- Use 2-3 relevant hashtags (#SaaS, #ContentMarketing, #AI)

### Email List

**Why:** Highest engagement rate, you own the audience
**How:**
- Weekly or bi-weekly newsletter featuring new content
- Personal intro explaining why this matters
- Preview the key points, link to full post

---

## Tier 2: Community Sharing (High ROI, Requires Nuance)

These communities can drive traffic but have anti-promotion cultures. Lead with value.

### Reddit

**Relevant Subreddits:**
- r/SaaS (130k members) — Share as "here's what I learned" not "here's my product"
- r/Entrepreneur (2.5M) — Must provide value, no blatant promotion
- r/marketing (500k) — Educational content works well
- r/content_marketing (80k) — Specifically relevant
- r/smallbusiness (1.5M) — If angle is for SMBs

**How to Post:**
1. Don't link directly to your blog in the post
2. Write valuable content natively in Reddit
3. If someone asks for more, share the link
4. Or add "I wrote more about this [here]" as a comment

**Example Post for "50 Questions" article:**
```
Title: The questions I ask in customer interviews (and why most interviews suck)

Been doing customer research for 3 years. Here's what I've learned about getting useful answers:

1. "How do you like our product?" = useless
2. "Walk me through your week before you found us" = gold

The difference is you're asking for a story, not an evaluation.

A few questions that always work:
- "What was the specific moment you realized you needed to change something?"
- "What almost stopped you from signing up?"
- "What would you tell someone who's on the fence?"

[Continue with 5-7 more specific tips]

Happy to share my full question bank if useful.

### Indie Hackers

**Why:** Bootstrapped/solo founder audience = perfect ICP
**How:**
- "Build in public" style posts
- Share learnings, not promotions
- Engage with comments genuinely
- Your profile links to your product

**Post Ideas:**
- "How I'm building my content library from customer calls"
- "The customer interview questions that changed my marketing"
- "What I learned extracting content from 50 customer calls"

### Hacker News

**Why:** Can drive massive traffic if it hits front page
**Reality:** Very hard to get traction, anti-marketing culture
**Best approach:** Only share genuinely educational content with no promotional angle

**Good candidates:**
- "50 Customer Interview Questions" (useful resource)
- Technical posts about building the product (if you write them)

**Don't post:**
- Comparison articles (promotional)
- Anything that reads like marketing

### Facebook Groups

**Relevant Groups:**
- SaaS Growth Hacks (50k+)
- SaaS Founders & Entrepreneurs
- Content Marketing Lounge
- Coaches & Consultants Community

**How:**
- Join and participate before promoting
- Ask questions, provide answers
- Share "I wrote this resource, hope it helps"
- Don't spam multiple groups same day

## Tier 3: Repurpose & Syndicate

Turn blog posts into other formats for additional reach.

### Medium

**Why:** Built-in audience, SEO juice, "Import" feature preserves canonical
**How:**
1. Create Medium account (or Voxify publication)
2. Use "Import a story" to bring in blog post
3. This preserves canonical URL (no duplicate content penalty)
4. Add relevant tags (Marketing, SaaS, Content Marketing, AI)

### LinkedIn Articles

**Why:** Higher visibility than posts for long-form content
**How:**
- Publish full article on LinkedIn
- Different from your post promoting it
- Good for evergreen "pillar" content

### DEV.to / Hashnode (if technical)

**Why:** Developer audience, good for technical content
**Only if:** You have technical content about building Voxify

### Quora

**Why:** Long-tail SEO, answering real questions
**How:**
1. Search for questions related to your blog topic
2. Write helpful answers
3. Link to blog as "I wrote more about this here"

**Example Questions to Answer:**
- "How do I turn customer interviews into marketing content?"
- "What are the best customer interview questions?"
- "How is AI changing content marketing?"

---

## Tier 4: Outreach & Amplification

For high-quality pillar content, consider outreach.

### Newsletter Features

**Find newsletters in your niche:**
- Marketing newsletters (Marketing Brew, The Hustle, etc.)
- SaaS newsletters (SaaS Weekly, Product-Led Growth)
- Entrepreneurship newsletters

**Pitch:**
```
Subject: Resource for your readers: [Title]

Hi [Name],

I put together [description] that I think your audience would find useful.

[One line about what it is]
[One line about what makes it valuable]

Here's the link if you'd like to check it out: [URL]

No pressure—just thought it might be worth sharing if it fits.

Cheers,
Drew
```

### Podcast Outreach

**Podcasts where this content fits:**
- SaaS/startup podcasts
- Marketing podcasts
- Founder journey podcasts

**Pitch:** Offer to discuss customer-voice content, customer research, or your journey building Voxify

### Backlink Outreach

**For high-quality posts:**
1. Find articles that link to similar content (Ahrefs, SEMrush)
2. Reach out: "I noticed you linked to [X]. I wrote something similar that might be useful for your readers: [Y]"

---

## Key Principles

1. **Lead with value, not promotion.** Communities hate spam.
2. **Native content > link drops.** Write for each platform.
3. **Engage with responses.** Distribution doesn't end at posting.
4. **Don't do everything at once.** Pick 3-4 channels and do them well.
5. **Track what works.** Use UTM parameters to see where traffic comes from.

---

## UTM Parameters for Tracking

Always add UTM parameters to track channel performance:

```
https://getvoxify.com/blog/customer-calls-content?utm_source=linkedin&utm_medium=social&utm_campaign=blog_q1_2026

https://getvoxify.com/blog/50-questions?utm_source=reddit&utm_medium=community&utm_campaign=blog_q1_2026
```

This lets you see in Google Analytics (or PostHog) which channels drive traffic and conversions.

*Start with Tier 1 for every post. Add Tier 2 strategically. Use Tier 3 & 4 for your best content.*
