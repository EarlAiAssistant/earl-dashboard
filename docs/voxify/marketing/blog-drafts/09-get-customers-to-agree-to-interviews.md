# How to Get Customers to Agree to Interviews (Email Templates Included)

*The ask that gets 70% yes responses.*

---

You need customer interviews for case studies, testimonials, and marketing content.

But asking feels awkward. What if they say no? What if you annoy them? What if they're too busy?

Here's the thing: most customers will say yes—if you ask the right way.

This guide gives you the exact approach, timing, and email templates to get customers on the phone.

## Why Customers Say Yes

Before we get tactical, understand the psychology:

**1. They want to be helpful**
People who like your product genuinely want to see you succeed. Asking for their input makes them feel valued.

**2. They want recognition**
Being featured in a case study is free publicity. Many customers are happy to be highlighted.

**3. They want to process their experience**
Talking through a success reinforces it. The interview itself is valuable to them.

**4. They want relationship**
A call strengthens the connection. It's not just business; it's human.

**The key insight:** You're not asking for a favor. You're offering an opportunity to be heard, recognized, and connected.

## When to Ask

### Best Timing

**1. After a positive milestone**
- They achieved a goal
- They renewed their subscription
- They upgraded
- They referred someone

**2. After positive feedback**
- They sent a thank-you email
- They left a good review
- They said something nice on a call

**3. At regular intervals**
- 30 days after signup (early wins)
- 90 days (established value)
- Annual renewal (long-term proof)

### Worst Timing

- Right after a support issue
- During a busy season for them
- When they haven't used the product recently
- When the relationship is new and cold

## How to Ask

### The Simple Framework

1. **Acknowledge their success** (make it about them)
2. **Explain the ask clearly** (15-20 minutes, casual)
3. **Show the benefit to them** (recognition, exposure)
4. **Make it easy** (link to schedule, no back-and-forth)

### The Mindset Shift

Don't think: "I need something from them."
Think: "I'm inviting them to be featured and share their story."

The energy is completely different.

**Subject:** RE: [Original subject]

```
Hi [Name],

[Calendly link]

[Your name]
```

### If They Say "Too Busy"

Totally understand! Would it help if I sent a few questions via email instead? Takes 5 minutes, and I can write up the story from your responses.

Let me know what works better for you.

```
No problem—I'll follow up in [timeframe]. In the meantime, congrats again on [positive thing].

Talk soon!

## What to Offer in Return

Some customers are happy to help for free. Others need a nudge. Options:

**Low cost:**
- Feature in case study with backlinks
- Social media promotion of their company
- Logo on your "customers" page
- Early access to new features

**Medium cost:**
- Gift card ($25-50 Amazon/Starbucks)
- Free month of service
- Swag (t-shirt, mug)

**High cost:**
- Significant discount on renewal
- Free upgrade for a period
- Donation to charity of their choice

Match the incentive to the ask. For a 15-minute call, a simple feature is usually enough. For a video testimonial, consider a gift card.

## Response Rate Benchmarks

What to expect:

| Scenario | Expected Response | Notes |
|----------|-------------------|-------|
| Warm customer, recent win | 50-70% | Best case |
| Regular customer, good terms | 30-50% | Solid |
| Quiet customer, no recent contact | 10-20% | Needs nurturing first |
| Cold list blast | 5-10% | Not recommended |

**Key insight:** Response rate is mostly about relationship warmth, not email copy. Nurture first, ask second.

## Common Objections and Responses

**"I'm too busy right now"**
> "Totally understand. Would a 15-minute call in 2-3 weeks work better? I can send a calendar link for then."

**"I'm not sure I have much to share"**
> "Actually, the everyday experiences are the most valuable. Just hearing how you use [Product] in your workflow is exactly what we're looking for."

**"Can we just do it via email?"**
> "Absolutely—I can send a few questions and write up your story from there. Would that work better?"

**"What questions will you ask?"**
> "Nothing scary! Just: What was going on before, what's changed since, and what advice you'd give others. Casual conversation, not an interrogation."

---

## After the Interview

**Same day:**
- Send thank-you email
- Confirm next steps (you'll share draft)

**Within 1 week:**
- Share draft for approval
- Ask for photo/logo if not provided

**After publishing:**
- Share the final link
- Tag them on social (with permission)
- Thank them again

This follow-through increases future participation and referrals.
