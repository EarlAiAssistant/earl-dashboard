## Category 1: Problem Awareness Posts

### Template 1.1: The Frustration Hook

```
Every [business type] has this problem:

You finish an incredible [customer call/interview/sales call].
They said brilliant things.
Things that would make perfect [marketing copy/testimonials/case studies].

Then... nothing.

The recording sits in a folder.
You "plan to get to it later."
Later never comes.

I've been there. [Personal example of a call you never extracted content from]

That's why I built Voxify—to make it impossible to waste another great conversation.

### Template 1.2: The Math Post

```
Quick math on customer calls:

Average call: 30 minutes
Average transcription: 4,500 words
Average usable quotes: 10-15
Potential content pieces: 20+

Reality for most businesses:
- Calls recorded: many
- Content extracted: almost none

You're sitting on a goldmine and don't even know it.

What if you could turn every call into weeks of content... in 60 seconds?

That's what we're building at Voxify.

### Template 1.3: The Relatable Scenario

```
POV: You're a [consultant/founder/marketer]

Monday: Amazing customer call. "We should turn this into a case study!"
Tuesday: Busy with other stuff
Wednesday: What call?
Thursday: Maybe next week
Friday: The call is now a distant memory

Sound familiar?

This used to be me. Every. Single. Week.

The problem isn't motivation. It's friction. Turning a transcript into content takes hours.

Unless you automate it.

Working on something to fix this. More soon.

## Category 2: Solution/Product Posts

### Template 2.1: The Simple Demo

```
60 seconds.

That's how long it takes to turn a customer call into:
→ Website copy
→ Email drafts
→ Social posts
→ FAQ answers

Upload a transcript. Click generate. Done.

No prompts to write.
No copy-paste into ChatGPT.
No spending hours reformatting.

Building this at Voxify. DM me if you want early access.
```

### Template 2.2: The Before/After

```
Before Voxify:
- 45-minute customer call
- 2 hours transcribing and highlighting
- 1 hour writing case study
- 1 hour creating social posts
- Maybe next month I'll get to the emails...
- Total: 4+ hours

After Voxify:
- 45-minute customer call
- 60 seconds uploading transcript
- 30 minutes reviewing and publishing
- Total: ~75 minutes

Same input. 4x the output. Fraction of the time.

This is what we're building.
```

### Template 2.3: The "Here's What It Does"

```
What Voxify does:

1. You upload a customer call transcript
2. AI extracts the gold—pain points, results, quotable moments
3. You get ready-to-use content:
   - Website copy that sounds like your customers
   - Email drafts using their language
   - Social posts with built-in hooks
   - FAQ answers to real objections

What it doesn't do:
- Write generic marketing fluff
- Require you to become a prompt engineer
- Take hours of your time

Simple. Fast. Authentic.

## Category 3: Insight/Value Posts

### Template 3.1: The Counterintuitive Insight

```
Hot take: Your copywriter will never write better than your customers.

Here's why:

Customers describe problems using the exact words your prospects think in.
Copywriters translate those words into "professional" marketing speak.

The translation loses magic.

"I was drowning in spreadsheets" → "Streamline your workflow"

Which one hits harder?

The best marketing doesn't come from writers.
It comes from listening.
```

### Template 3.2: The Process Share

```
How I turn one customer call into 3 weeks of content:

1. Record every customer call (with permission)
2. Get the transcript (automatic with most tools now)
3. Look for 3 things:
   - Pain quotes ("I was struggling with...")
   - Result quotes ("Now we can...")
   - Decision quotes ("What convinced me was...")
4. Turn pain quotes → ad copy, landing page headers
5. Turn result quotes → case studies, testimonials
6. Turn decision quotes → FAQ, objection handling

One call. 20+ content pieces. No copywriter needed.

What's your content extraction process?
```

### Template 3.3: The Listicle

```
5 things your customers say that are better than any copywriter:

1. How they describe the problem (in their words, not yours)
2. What they tried before that didn't work (competitive ammo)
3. What almost stopped them from buying (objections to address)
4. The specific result they achieved (proof that converts)
5. What they'd tell a friend (peer-to-peer messaging)

You're collecting this data already.
You're just not extracting it.

Start with your next call.

## Category 5: Engagement Posts

### Template 5.1: The Question Post

```
Question for [target audience]:

When you finish a great customer call, what happens next?

A) I manually extract quotes and write content (hours)
B) I throw it in a folder and never look at it again
C) I have a system that makes content from calls automatically
D) Wait, I should be recording customer calls?

Drop your letter below. Curious to see where most people are.
```

### Template 5.2: The Poll (if LinkedIn polls are available)

```
How many customer calls have you turned into marketing content in the last month?

🔵 0 (no time)
🟢 1-2 (when I remember)
🟡 3-5 (pretty consistent)
🔴 6+ (I have a system)

Share your approach in the comments!
```

### Template 5.3: The Hot Take Discussion

```
Controversial opinion:

Most AI writing tools make content worse, not better.

They optimize for volume over authenticity.
They strip out the human voice.
They create generic content that sounds like everyone else.

The solution isn't "more AI."
It's using AI to extract human voices, not replace them.

Agree? Disagree? Tell me why.

## Pro Tips

1. **First line matters most** — It's what shows before "see more." Make it hook.

2. **Use line breaks** — Dense paragraphs get skipped. White space = readability.

3. **End with engagement prompt** — Questions, requests for opinions, or CTAs drive comments.

4. **Link in comments, not post** — LinkedIn deprioritizes posts with links in the body.

5. **Reply to every comment** — First hour engagement signals quality to the algorithm.

6. **Don't sell every post** — 4:1 ratio of value posts to promotional posts.

7. **Use your own experience** — Templates are starting points. Personal details make them real.
