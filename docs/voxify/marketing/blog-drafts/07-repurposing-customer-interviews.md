# Repurposing Customer Interviews: 20+ Content Types From One Call

*One conversation. Endless content. Here's how to extract it all.*

---

You finished a customer interview. Now what?

Most people create one thing—maybe a case study, maybe a testimonial—and move on.

That's like finding a gold mine and taking home a single nugget.

A single 30-minute customer call contains enough material for weeks of content across every channel you use. Here's the complete list of what you can create, and how to extract it.

---

## The Content Opportunity

Before we dive in, let's establish what a typical customer interview contains:

**Raw material in a 30-minute call:**
- 4,000-5,000 words of transcript
- 10-15 quotable moments
- 3-5 distinct pain points discussed
- 2-3 specific results mentioned
- 1-2 objections they overcame
- Multiple emotional moments

**Potential output:**
- 20+ pieces of content
- Across 10+ channels/formats
- Weeks of publishing material

The math is simple: extract more, publish more, waste less.
