# Cold Outreach Email Templates for Voxify

*Personalized templates for different target audiences.*

---

## General Principles

1. **Keep it short** — Under 100 words ideal, 150 max
2. **Lead with their problem**, not your product
3. **Personalize the first line** — Reference something specific about them
4. **One CTA only** — Don't overwhelm
5. **Follow up 2-3 times** — Most responses come from follow-ups

## Audience 1: Consultants & Coaches

### Template 1A: The Direct Approach

**Subject:** Your customer calls

```
Hi [Name],

Quick question—do you do customer/client interviews as part of your work?

I built a tool that turns those call transcripts into marketing content (case studies, testimonials, social posts) in about 60 seconds.

Most consultants I talk to have hours of great conversations sitting in folders, never becoming content.

Would you be open to trying it? Free to test with one transcript.

Cheers,
Drew

### Template 1B: The Problem-First Approach

**Subject:** Those customer calls you never do anything with

```
Hi [Name],

Saw your work on [specific project/post]—impressive stuff.

Random question: How do you handle turning client calls into content?

I ask because most consultants I know have the same problem: Great conversations happen, insights get shared, then... nothing. The recordings sit in a folder.

I built Voxify to fix this. Upload a transcript, get case study material, social posts, and testimonial quotes in 60 seconds.

Worth a look?

### Follow-up (Day 3)

**Subject:** RE: Your customer calls

```
Hi [Name],

Just following up on my note below.

If customer interviews → content isn't a pain point for you, no worries at all.

But if you've got call recordings collecting dust, might be worth 5 minutes to check out what we built.

### Follow-up (Day 7)

**Subject:** Last one from me

```
Hi [Name],

Don't want to be annoying—this is my last follow-up.

If turning customer conversations into content ever becomes a priority, Voxify's here: [Link]

Best of luck with everything!

## Audience 2: SaaS Founders

### Template 2A: The Build-in-Public Connection

**Subject:** Fellow founder—quick question

```
Hi [Name],

Saw your [recent post/product launch/milestone]—congrats!

Building Voxify over here. We turn customer call transcripts into marketing content (website copy, case studies, social posts) automatically.

Curious if you do customer interviews? Most founders I know have tons of call recordings that never become content (I was one of them).

Would you try it and give me honest feedback? Free access for fellow founders.

Drew
```

### Template 2B: The Specific Pain Point

**Subject:** Those customer success stories you never write

```
Hi [Name],

Quick question—how many case studies have you published in the last 6 months?

If the answer is "not as many as we should," you're not alone. Most SaaS founders I talk to have the same problem: great customer conversations, no time to turn them into content.

I built Voxify for exactly this. Upload a customer call transcript, get a case study draft in 60 seconds.

Worth a look: [Link]

## Audience 3: Marketing Managers

### Template 3A: The Efficiency Angle

**Subject:** Your customer testimonial process

```
Hi [Name],

Question—how long does it take your team to turn a customer interview into a case study or testimonial?

Asking because I built a tool that does it in about 60 seconds.

Upload transcript → Get case study draft, testimonial quotes, social posts, FAQ content.

If customer stories are part of your content strategy, might be worth checking out: [Link]

Drew
```

### Template 3B: The Content Volume Angle

**Subject:** Getting more mileage from customer calls

```
Hi [Name],

Noticed [Company] is doing some great customer marketing lately.

Quick question—do you have a system for extracting content from customer conversations?

Most marketing teams I work with struggle to keep up. One customer call could become 20+ pieces of content, but extraction takes forever.

Built Voxify to solve this. Might be useful for your team: [Link]

## Audience 4: Agency Owners

### Template 4A: The Scale Problem

**Subject:** Scaling customer success stories

```
Hi [Name],

Running an agency means tons of client wins—but turning those into case studies and testimonials takes forever.

I built Voxify for exactly this problem.

Upload a client call transcript. Get a case study draft, testimonial quotes, and social content in 60 seconds.

Would be curious what you think: [Link]

Drew
```

### Template 4B: The Team Efficiency Angle

**Subject:** Your content team's time

```
Hi [Name],

How much time does your team spend turning client conversations into marketing content?

For most agencies I've talked to, it's 3-4 hours per case study—if they get to it at all.

Built a tool that cuts that to minutes. Upload transcript, get content.

Worth a look for [Agency Name]?

## Response Handling

### Interested but busy

```
Totally understand. Here's a quick demo video that shows how it works in 2 minutes: [Link]

When you have time, let me know what you think!
```

### Asking for more info

```
Sure! In a nutshell:

1. Upload a customer call transcript
2. Voxify extracts pain points, results, and quotable moments
3. You get website copy, case study draft, social posts, and FAQ content
4. Takes about 60 seconds

Here's a 2-min demo: [Link]

Happy to answer any other questions!
```

### Not interested

```
No worries at all—appreciate you letting me know.

If things change, we're here: [Link]

Best of luck with everything!
```

### Objection: "I use ChatGPT"

```
Totally valid! ChatGPT is powerful.

The main difference is workflow. ChatGPT requires prompting for each output type. Voxify is purpose-built for customer transcripts—one upload, all content types generated automatically.

For occasional use, ChatGPT works great. If you're doing 3-4+ customer interviews per month, Voxify saves significant time.

Worth comparing: [Link]

Either way, keep extracting content from those calls!
