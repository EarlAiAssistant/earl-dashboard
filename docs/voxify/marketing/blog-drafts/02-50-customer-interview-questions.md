# 50 Customer Interview Questions That Get Quotable Answers

*The questions you ask determine the content you get. Ask better questions.*

---

Most customer interviews are wasted opportunities.

Not because customers don't have valuable things to say—but because interviewers ask the wrong questions.

"How do you like our product?" gets you "It's great!"
That's useless for marketing.

"Walk me through what happened the week before you started looking for a solution" gets you a story. Stories convert.

This guide gives you 50 questions organized by what you're trying to create—so every interview produces content you can actually use.

## How to Use This Guide

**Before your interview:**
1. Decide what content you need (case study? testimonials? objection handling?)
2. Pick 8-12 questions from the relevant sections
3. Print them out or keep them visible

**During the interview:**
- Let them talk—follow-up questions are often better than your script
- Don't rush to the next question—silence encourages elaboration
- Take note of exact phrases (these become your marketing copy)

**After the interview:**
- Highlight the most quotable moments
- Match responses to content types (see the end of this guide)

## Pro Tips for Better Interviews

### 1. Record Everything
Always ask permission, but always record. You'll miss the best quotes if you're taking notes.

### 2. Embrace Silence
When you ask a question, wait. Count to 5 in your head. Customers will fill the silence with gold.

### 3. Follow the Emotion
If they say something with energy—positive or negative—dig in. "Tell me more about that."

### 4. Ask for Specifics
"Great" doesn't help. "Can you give me a specific example?" does.

### 5. Use Their Words Back
"You mentioned you were 'drowning in spreadsheets'—can you walk me through what that looked like?"
