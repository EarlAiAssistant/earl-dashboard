# 7 Customer Interview Mistakes That Kill Your Marketing Content

*And how to fix them before your next call.*

---

You're doing customer interviews. Good.

But are you getting content you can actually use? Most people aren't.

After reviewing hundreds of customer interviews (both mine and clients'), I've identified the mistakes that turn gold mines into dead ends.

Here's what to avoid—and what to do instead.

---

## Mistake #1: Asking Yes/No Questions

**The problem:**

"Did you like our onboarding process?"
"Yes."

"Was the product easy to use?"
"Yes."

Useless. You can't build content from monosyllables.

**The fix:**

Turn every yes/no question into an open-ended one:

❌ "Did you find the product easy to use?"
✅ "Walk me through your first week using the product. What surprised you?"

❌ "Were you happy with the results?"
✅ "Tell me about a specific moment when you realized this was working."

❌ "Would you recommend us?"
✅ "If you were explaining this to a colleague, what would you tell them?"

Open-ended questions generate stories. Stories generate content.

## Mistake #2: Leading the Witness

**The problem:**

"So you really struggled with manual processes before finding us, right?"

You've put words in their mouth. Even if they agree, it's your language, not theirs. And their language is what converts.

**The fix:**

Stay neutral. Let them describe things their way:

❌ "I imagine you were frustrated with slow response times?"
✅ "What was the biggest frustration before you found a solution?"

❌ "You must have saved a ton of time, right?"
✅ "What changed after you started using this?"

The goal is discovery, not confirmation.

## Mistake #3: Not Pushing for Specifics

**The problem:**

Customer: "It's been great."
You: "Awesome. So, next question..."

"Great" isn't content. Neither is "really helpful" or "much better."

**The fix:**

Always follow up vague statements with a request for specifics:

"You mentioned it's been great—can you give me a specific example?"

"When you say 'much better,' can you walk me through what that looks like day-to-day?"

"You said it saved time. Do you have a rough sense of how much time per week?"

Numbers and stories beat adjectives every time.

## Mistake #4: Talking Too Much

**The problem:**

You ask a question. They start to answer. You jump in to clarify, add context, or share your own experience.

Now they're answering a different question, or worse, they've lost their train of thought.

**The fix:**

Ask. Then shut up.

Silence feels awkward. Let it. Count to five in your head before speaking.

Customers will fill the silence. Often with the most interesting material.

The best interviewers have a 20/80 talk ratio. You talk 20%, they talk 80%.

## Mistake #5: Skipping the "Before" Story

**The problem:**

You jump straight to asking about your product:

"How do you use our tool?"
"What features do you like?"
"What results have you seen?"

You get answers, but they lack context and emotional weight.

**The fix:**

Spend the first 10-15 minutes on life before you:

"Walk me through what things looked like before you found a solution."
"What had you tried that didn't work?"
"What was that costing you—in time, money, or just frustration?"

The "before" state makes the "after" meaningful. Without contrast, your case study falls flat.

## Mistake #6: Forgetting to Ask About Objections

**The problem:**

You focus on the good stuff—pain points, results, satisfaction.

But you never ask what almost went wrong.

**The fix:**

Always include:

"What almost stopped you from signing up?"
"Was there anything you were worried about before starting?"
"What would you tell someone who's hesitant to try this?"

These answers become your FAQ, your objection-handling scripts, your "why not us" content. Gold for your sales team.

---

## Mistake #7: Not Recording (Or Recording and Never Using It)

**The problem:**

You take notes during the call. Notes are incomplete. You miss exact wording, tone, and context.

Or, you record but the recording sits in a folder forever.

Either way, you capture maybe 10% of the value.

**The fix:**

Always record (with permission). This is non-negotiable.

Then, within 48 hours:

1. Get the transcript (automatic with most tools)
2. Highlight quotable moments
3. Extract content or use a tool like Voxify to do it automatically
4. Create and schedule the content

If you wait longer than 48 hours, you probably won't do it at all.

## The Master Checklist

Before your next customer interview, review this:

**Questions to ask:**
- [ ] "Walk me through life before you found a solution"
- [ ] "What had you tried that didn't work?"
- [ ] "What was that costing you?"
- [ ] "Why did you choose us over alternatives?"
- [ ] "What almost stopped you from signing up?"
- [ ] "Can you give me a specific example of results?"
- [ ] "What would you tell someone considering this?"

**During the call:**
- [ ] Recording is on (with permission)
- [ ] I'm talking less than 20% of the time
- [ ] I'm following up vague answers with "Can you be more specific?"
- [ ] I'm letting silence do the work

**After the call (within 48 hours):**
- [ ] Transcript obtained
- [ ] Key moments highlighted
- [ ] Content extracted or queued for extraction
- [ ] At least one piece created and scheduled

## Why This Matters

A great customer interview generates:
- Case study material
- Testimonial quotes
- Homepage copy
- Email content
- Social posts
- FAQ answers
- Sales talking points

A bad customer interview generates:
- Vague notes
- Generic quotes like "It's great!"
- Nothing you can actually publish

Same time investment. Wildly different outcomes.

The difference is technique.

## Quick Wins

**If you only fix one thing:** Stop asking yes/no questions. That alone will transform your interviews.

**If you fix two things:** Add "Can you give me a specific example?" to your vocabulary. Use it every time someone says something vague.

**If you fix three things:** Always spend the first third of the interview on the "before" state. The contrast makes everything else more powerful.
