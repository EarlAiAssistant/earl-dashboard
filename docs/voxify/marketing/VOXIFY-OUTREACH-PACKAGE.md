Subject: Did you see this?

Hey [First Name],

I sent an email a few days ago about Voxify launching - not sure if it landed in your inbox.

Quick recap: Voxify turns customer call transcripts into marketing content (website copy, emails, social posts, FAQs) in about 60 seconds.

You signed up for the waitlist, so I wanted to make sure you got access.

Here's your link: https://getvoxify.com

If you have a transcript from a recent call, try uploading it - I'd love to hear what you think.

And if this isn't relevant anymore, no worries. Just reply "remove" and I'll take you off the list.

Thanks,
Drew

P.S. - If you don't have a transcript handy, most video call tools (Zoom, Meet, Teams) auto-generate them. Happy to help if you need guidance.

## 2. LinkedIn DM Templates

### Template A: For Marketing Consultants/Freelancers

```
Hey [Name],

Saw your work helping [companies/clients] with their marketing - looks great.

Quick question: Do you ever do customer interviews or calls as part of your process?

I built a tool called Voxify that turns call transcripts into marketing content (website copy, emails, social posts) in 60 seconds. Thinking it might save you a ton of time.

Would love your feedback if you have 5 min to check it out: getvoxify.com

No pressure either way - just thought of you when I saw your profile.

### Template B: For Agency Owners

```
Hey [Name],

Love what you're building at [Agency Name].

Random question - how do you handle turning client calls/interviews into case studies or content? I'm curious because I built something to solve that exact problem.

Voxify takes a call transcript and generates marketing content from it automatically. A few agency folks have told me it saves them 3-4 hours per case study.

Would love your take: getvoxify.com

Either way, keep up the great work.

### Template C: For Coaches/Consultants

```
Hey [Name],

I came across your profile and saw you work with [type of clients].

Quick question: Do you record your client calls? If so, what do you do with those recordings after?

I ask because I built Voxify - it turns call transcripts into content (testimonials, case studies, social posts) in about a minute. A lot of coaches have gold in their call recordings that never gets used.

Would love your feedback: getvoxify.com

### Template D: For SaaS Founders

```
Hey [Name],

Fellow founder here - just launched Voxify a couple weeks ago.

I noticed [Company] is in the [space] - do you do customer interviews or success calls?

I built Voxify to solve my own problem: I had tons of great customer calls but never turned them into content because it took too long.

Now I upload a transcript and get website copy, emails, and social posts in 60 seconds.

Would love your feedback if you have a sec: getvoxify.com

Either way, congrats on what you're building.

## Sample Reddit Post

**Title:** I built a tool that turns customer calls into marketing content - would love feedback

**Body:**
```
Hey everyone,

I'm a software engineer at FedEx building a SaaS on the side. Just launched Voxify a couple weeks ago.

The problem: I kept having great customer calls but never turned them into content because it took 3-4 hours per call to extract quotes, write case studies, etc.

The solution: Upload a transcript → get website copy, emails, social posts, and FAQs in 60 seconds. It uses AI to extract the valuable parts and structure them.

Here's the site: getvoxify.com

Would love feedback from anyone who does customer interviews or calls. What would make this useful for you?

(And yes, I know I need more case studies on my own site - working on it 😅)

## Sample Indie Hackers Post

**Title:** From PM to self-taught dev to launching my first SaaS - Voxify journey

**Body:**
```
Hey IH 👋

Quick background: Quit my IT PM job, taught myself Flutter, did some freelancing, and now work at FedEx as a software engineer while building on the side.

Just launched Voxify - it turns customer call transcripts into marketing content (website copy, emails, social posts).

The origin: I was doing customer interviews for a previous project and realized I had hours of gold sitting in recordings that I never used because turning it into content took forever.

So I built the thing I wished existed.

**Stack:** Next.js, Supabase, Stripe, Claude API

**Current MRR:** ~$0 (just launched, have a few trial users)

**What I've learned so far:**
- Building is the easy part. Marketing is hard.
- LinkedIn is better than Twitter for B2B
- Customer interviews > assumptions (ironic given what I built)

Would love to connect with other founders in the content/marketing tool space.
