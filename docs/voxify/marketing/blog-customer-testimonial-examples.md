You know testimonials are important.

But when you look at your competitors' websites, their testimonials are... bland.

> "Great product! Highly recommend."  
> — John D.

Cool. Super convincing. 🙄

**Good testimonials** do more than say "it's great." They:
- Tell a specific story
- Include real numbers
- Sound like a real human talking
- Overcome objections

This guide shows you 25 real testimonial examples (organized by type) plus templates you can copy.

## Why Testimonials Matter

**73% of buyers** say testimonials and reviews are important in their purchasing decision. (Source: BrightLocal)

But not all testimonials are created equal.

**Bad testimonial:**
> "Love this product! 5 stars ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐"  
> — Sarah M.

**Good testimonial:**
> "This tool saved us 13 hours a week. We reinvested that time into growth and closed $180k in new business. Best investment we've made."  
> — Sarah Martinez, Marketing Consultant

**See the difference?**

Good testimonials:
- Are specific (13 hours, $180k)
- Include context (who they are, what they do)
- Show transformation (before → after)
- Feel authentic (real person, real results)

## 25 Testimonial Examples (By Type)

### Type 1: Time-Saving Testimonials

**Use when:** Your product saves customers time.

**Example 1:**
> "Before [Product], I spent 15 hours a week on client reports. Now it takes 2 hours. That's 52 hours a month I can spend on actual strategy work instead of spreadsheets."  
> — Sarah Martinez, Marketing Consultant

**Why it works:** Specific numbers (15 → 2 hours), clear benefit (strategy vs. spreadsheets)

---

**Example 2:**
> "We used to waste 3 days every month reconciling invoices manually. [Product] automated it. Now it's done in 30 minutes. That's 2.5 days back per month."  
> — Michael Chen, Finance Manager at TechCo

**Why it works:** Before/after comparison (3 days → 30 min), quantified impact

**Example 3:**
> "The first time I used [Product], I finished in 10 minutes what used to take me 3 hours. I literally said 'wait, what?' out loud."  
> — Lisa Wang, Operations Director

**Why it works:** Authentic reaction ("wait, what?"), dramatic improvement (3 hours → 10 min)

---

### Type 2: Revenue-Impact Testimonials

**Why it works:** Specific revenue ($180k), clear causation (automation → capacity → new clients)

**Why it works:** Precise numbers (2.1% → 3.8%), quantified impact ($50k/month)

---

**Example 6:**

## How to Structure Testimonials

**Three versions for different contexts:**

> "This tool saved us 13 hours a week."  
> — Sarah M., Consultant

### Medium (2-3 sentences) – For landing pages
> "Before [Product], we spent 15 hours/week on reports. Now it takes 2 hours. We reinvested that time into strategy calls and closed 3 new clients this quarter."  
> — Sarah M., Marketing Consultant

### Long (4-5 sentences) – For case study pages
> "Honestly, I was skeptical. We'd tried other tools and they never worked. But [Product] actually delivers. What used to take 15 hours now takes 2. We used that extra time to deepen client relationships—and it directly led to $180k in new business. Best investment we've made."  
> — Sarah Martinez, Marketing Consultant at SoloAgency

**Use the right length for the context.**

---

## Testimonial Formatting Best Practices

### 1. Always Include Attribution
**Bad:**
> "Great product!"

**Good:**
> "Great product!"  
> — Sarah Martinez, Marketing Consultant

**Why:** Credibility. Anonymous quotes feel fake.

---

### 2. Use Real Photos (When Possible)
**Better:**
> [Customer headshot] "This tool saved us 13 hours/week."  
> — Sarah Martinez

**Why:** Human faces = trust.

---

### 3. Add Company Context
> "This tool saved us 13 hours/week."  
> — Sarah Martinez, Marketing Consultant at SoloAgency  
> [Company logo]

**Why:** Shows it's a real company, not a fake review.

---

### 4. Highlight Key Phrases
> "This tool saved us **13 hours a week**. We reinvested that time into growth and closed **$180k in new business**."

**Why:** Numbers jump out, easier to scan.

---

### 5. Use Pull Quotes for Visual Impact
Create graphics with the best line:
- Plain background
- Large quote
- Customer photo + name

**Example:**
> [Graphic]  
> "The time I save is worth $8,000/month.  
> And I'm paying $47. It's not even close."  
>  
> — Sarah Martinez, Consultant

---

## Where to Use Testimonials

### Homepage
- 1-2 short testimonials above the fold
- 3-5 medium testimonials in social proof section

### Landing Pages
- 1 testimonial near headline (builds immediate trust)
- 3-4 testimonials throughout page (address objections)

### Pricing Page
- 2-3 testimonials emphasizing ROI/value

### Product Pages
- Feature-specific testimonials (e.g., "The reporting feature saved us 10 hours/week")

### Email Signatures
- Short testimonial as social proof

### Sales Decks
- 1-2 high-impact testimonials per slide

### Social Media
- Turn testimonials into graphics, carousels, posts

---

## How to Get Great Testimonials

### 1. Ask Specific Questions
**Don't ask:** "Can you write a testimonial?"

**Do ask:**
- "What problem were you facing before using [Product]?"
- "How much time/money has it saved you?"
- "What would you tell a colleague about [Product]?"

### 2. Pull From Customer Interviews
The best testimonials come from actual conversations, not forms.

**During interview:**
- Listen for quotable moments
- Ask follow-up: "Can I quote you on that?"
- Get permission to use their name/company

### 3. Offer to Draft It
**Email template:**
> "Hey [Name], would you be comfortable with me using this as a testimonial?
>
> '[Quote from your interview]'
>
> Let me know if you'd like me to adjust anything!"

Most people say yes. Saves them time.
