## General Questions

### What is Voxify?

Voxify is an AI-powered tool that transforms customer call transcripts into ready-to-use marketing content. Upload a transcript from any customer conversation—sales calls, interviews, support calls, success stories—and get website copy, email drafts, social posts, and FAQ answers in about 60 seconds.

### How is Voxify different from ChatGPT?

ChatGPT is a general-purpose AI that requires prompt engineering to get good output. You have to figure out what to ask for, write custom prompts for each content type, and iterate to improve results.

Voxify is purpose-built for one job: extracting marketing content from customer conversations. You don't write prompts—just upload a transcript and click generate. We know exactly what to look for (pain points, results, quotable moments) and how to structure the output.

**The practical difference:** ChatGPT takes 30-60 minutes of prompting per transcript. Voxify takes 60 seconds.

### What types of content does Voxify generate?

Every transcript generates four types of content:

1. **Website Copy** — Hero headlines, feature descriptions, benefit statements, and CTAs using your customers' language

2. **Email Drafts** — Pain-focused openers, story-driven nurture emails, and proof-packed conversion emails

3. **Social Posts** — LinkedIn posts, Twitter content, and quote-worthy snippets ready to publish

4. **FAQ Answers** — Real objections addressed, common questions answered using authentic customer voice

### What types of calls work best?

Voxify works with any customer conversation where someone talks about their problems, experience, or results:

- ✅ Customer interviews
- ✅ Sales discovery calls
- ✅ Customer success calls
- ✅ Onboarding conversations
- ✅ Support calls
- ✅ Testimonial interviews
- ✅ User research sessions

Even a 20-minute conversation can generate substantial content.

## Getting Started

### How do I upload a transcript?

Three options:

1. **Paste text** — Copy/paste your transcript directly into the upload area
2. **Upload file** — Drag and drop a .txt, .docx, or supported file format
3. **Audio upload** — Upload an audio/video file and we'll transcribe it for you *(coming soon)*

### Do I need speaker labels in my transcript?

Speaker labels help (e.g., "Interviewer:" and "Customer:") but aren't required. Voxify can work with raw conversation text and will still extract the valuable content.

### How long does generation take?

About 60 seconds per transcript. You'll see a progress indicator while we process.

### Can I edit the generated content?

Yes. All generated content is fully editable. We recommend reviewing and making small tweaks before publishing—but many users publish directly with minimal changes.

## Privacy & Security

### Is my data private?

Yes. Your transcripts and generated content are 100% private to your account. We never share, sell, or use your data for any purpose other than providing the service.

### Is my data used to train AI models?

No. Your transcripts are never used for AI training. They're processed to generate your content, then stored only for your access.

## Content Quality

### Does the AI content sound authentic?

This is what makes Voxify different. Unlike generic AI writing tools that invent language, Voxify extracts and uses your customers' actual words.

The output sounds authentic because it IS authentic—built from real conversations with real customers. We're not generating marketing speak; we're identifying and structuring the valuable language that already exists in your transcripts.

### Will all my content sound the same?

No. Each generation is based on the specific transcript you upload. Different customers, different conversations, different output.

If you want consistent brand voice across all content, we recommend light editing to add your company's specific terminology and style.

### What if I don't like the generated content?

You can regenerate, edit, or ignore any content that doesn't meet your standards. We're constantly improving quality based on user feedback.

### Can I give feedback on content quality?

Yes. Each content section has a thumbs up/down button. This feedback helps us improve the generation quality over time.
