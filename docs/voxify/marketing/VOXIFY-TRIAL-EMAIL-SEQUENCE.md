## Day 1: Quick Win Nudge

**Subject:** Did you try it yet?

**Send:** 24 hours after signup (skip if they've already generated)

```
Hey [Name],

Quick check-in—have you uploaded your first transcript yet?

If not, here's an easy way to test Voxify in 2 minutes:

1. Think of a recent customer call or interview
2. Grab the transcript (or even just a summary)
3. Paste it in
4. See what comes out

No perfect transcript required. Even messy notes work.

👉 Try it now: [Button: Upload Transcript]

The first "wow" moment usually happens around the 30-second mark. Let me know what you think!

P.S. Don't have a transcript handy? We have sample transcripts you can try: [Link to samples]

## Day 3: Value Education

**Subject:** What one transcript can become

**Send:** Day 3 (skip if high engagement)

```
Hey [Name],

Most people underestimate what a single customer conversation contains.

Here's what one 30-minute call can generate in Voxify:

✅ **Website Copy**
- Hero headline using their pain language
- Feature descriptions in their words
- Benefit statements that actually resonate

✅ **Email Drafts**  
- Pain-focused opener
- Story-driven nurture email
- Proof-packed conversion email

✅ **Social Posts**
- LinkedIn posts with built-in hooks
- Twitter threads ready to schedule
- Quote graphics material

✅ **FAQ Content**
- Real objections answered
- Common questions addressed
- Sales enablement material

That's 20+ pieces from one conversation.

Now multiply that by every customer call you've ever done.

## Day 5: Social Proof

**Subject:** "I went from 3 hours to 15 minutes"

**Send:** Day 5

```
Hey [Name],

Quick story from a Voxify user:

---

*"I used to spend 3-4 hours turning a customer interview into a case study. Between transcription, highlighting quotes, and actually writing—it was a full afternoon.*

*Now? I upload the transcript to Voxify, grab the case study draft, make a few tweaks, and publish. Maybe 45 minutes total.*

*Last month I published 4 case studies. Before Voxify, I might have done 1."*

— Sarah, Marketing Director

Sarah's not unique. The pattern we see:

**Before Voxify:**
- Customer calls happen → content doesn't
- "I'll get to it later" → later never comes
- Great quotes → forgotten

**After Voxify:**
- Customer calls happen → content follows in minutes
- No backlog of "should write" content
- Every conversation becomes an asset

Which pattern do you want?

## Day 7: Check-In

**Subject:** Quick question

**Send:** Day 7

```
Hey [Name],

Your trial is halfway done—wanted to check in.

Have you had a chance to try Voxify yet?

If yes → What did you think? Reply and let me know.

If no → What's getting in the way? I'd genuinely like to help.

Common blockers I hear:
- "I don't have transcripts" → Most video call tools create them automatically now
- "Not sure if my calls are right for this" → Try one and see!
- "Haven't had time" → It literally takes 60 seconds

If there's something else stopping you, just reply. I'll do what I can to help you get value from the trial.

Drew

P.S. If you're just busy and plan to try it later—no pressure. But don't let the trial expire without at least one test run.

## Day 10: Urgency + Value Recap

**Subject:** 4 days left — don't miss this

**Send:** Day 10

```
Hey [Name],

Your Voxify trial ends in 4 days.

Before it does, I want to make sure you've seen what's possible.

**In 60 seconds, Voxify turns one customer transcript into:**
- Website copy that sounds like your customers
- Email drafts you can actually send
- Social posts with built-in hooks
- FAQ answers to real objections

**What that means for you:**
- Stop wasting customer calls
- Publish more content, faster
- Use customer language that actually converts

**What it costs:**
- Starter: $29/mo (10 generations)
- Pro: $79/mo (30 generations)
- Business: $199/mo (100 generations)

One case study from an agency costs $500-2,000.
One month of Voxify pays for itself with a single use.

👉 Try it before your trial ends: [Button: Go to Dashboard]

If you've already tried it and have questions about upgrading, just reply.

## Day 13: Last Chance

**Subject:** Tomorrow: Your trial ends

**Send:** Day 13

```
Hey [Name],

This is it—your Voxify trial ends tomorrow.

If you haven't tried it yet, you have 24 hours to see what it can do.

Upload one transcript. Get website copy, emails, social posts, FAQs.

60 seconds. That's all it takes.

👉 Last chance: [Button: Try It Now]

If you've tried it and you're not sure it's for you—that's okay. I appreciate you giving it a shot.

But if it worked and you just haven't upgraded yet—tomorrow you'll lose access.

[Button: Choose Your Plan]

Thanks for trying Voxify. Hope to see you stick around.

**Send:** Day 14 (when trial expires)

```

## Bonus: Win-Back Sequence (30 days post-trial)

**Subject:** Still turning customer calls into content?

**Send:** 30 days after trial ended (if didn't convert)

```
Hey [Name],

It's been a month since your Voxify trial.

Quick question: How are you handling customer call → content these days?

If you're still doing it manually, here's a thought:

One hour of manual extraction = 2 months of Voxify.

We've also added [new feature/improvement] since you tried us.

Want to give it another shot? Here's 50% off your first month: [Code: COMEBACK50]

[Button: Try Again]

No pressure either way. Just didn't want you to forget we exist when the content backlog piles up again.

## Implementation Notes

### Conditional Logic

Skip emails if:
- User has high engagement (3+ generations)
- User already converted to paid
- User explicitly asked to stop emails

Upgrade to "power user" track if:
- 5+ generations in first week
- (Send testimonial request instead of conversion emails)

### Subject Line A/B Tests

Test these variations:
- Day 1: "Did you try it yet?" vs "Your first 60 seconds"
- Day 5: Quote vs "How Sarah publishes 4x more case studies"
- Day 10: "4 days left" vs "The math on your content"

### Personalization

Include when possible:
- Name
- Number of generations completed
- Days remaining in trial
- Content types generated

### Timing

- Send all emails at 9am in user's timezone
- If timezone unknown, default to 9am ET

---

## Metrics to Track

- **Open rate by email** (benchmark: 30-40%)
- **Click rate by email** (benchmark: 3-5%)
- **Reply rate** (engagement signal)
- **Conversion by email** (which email drives upgrades)
- **Overall trial → paid conversion** (goal: 20%+)

---

*Set up in Customer.io, Loops, or ConvertKit. Test and iterate based on data.*
