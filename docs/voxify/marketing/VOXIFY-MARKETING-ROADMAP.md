# Voxify Marketing Roadmap
## Solo Founder, Limited Budget Strategy
### Prepared for Meeting with Joseph "Trip" Gormley | February 2026

---

## Executive Summary

**Product:** Voxify – AI platform that transforms customer call transcripts into complete marketing campaigns (case studies, social posts, email copy, FAQs, testimonials) in 10 minutes instead of 10 hours.

**Current Status:** Product built, polished, and ready for growth. Initial LinkedIn posts, Facebook outreach, and Indiana startup network connections made.

**Goal:** Reach $15k MRR by Month 3 (product-market fit signal) → $80k MRR by Month 12

**Budget Constraint:** Bootstrap-friendly approach, prioritizing ROI and time-efficient tactics

---

## Competitive Positioning

### What We're NOT Selling
❌ "Another AI writing tool" (commoditized, crowded)

### What We ARE Selling
✅ "Turn every customer call into a complete marketing campaign in 10 minutes"

### Competitive Wedge
| Competitor | What They Do | Why Voxify Wins |
|------------|--------------|-----------------|
| **Otter.ai** | Transcription + summaries | We go 10 steps further → full marketing campaigns |
| **ChatGPT** | General AI (prompts required) | One-click workflow, no prompt engineering needed |
| **Jasper** | AI writing ($49/mo + Otter = $66/mo) | All-in-one, cheaper ($27-47/mo), specialized |
| **Descript** | Video editing + transcription | Built for marketers, not video editors |

### Unique Value Proposition
> "For consultants, coaches, and SaaS founders who conduct customer calls but struggle to turn insights into marketing content, Voxify transforms one transcript into 12+ ready-to-use assets in 10 minutes. Unlike ChatGPT or Jasper, we're purpose-built for customer conversations—no prompts, no copy-paste, just upload and go."

## What Trip (Xaris) Could Help With

Based on Xaris's positioning as "AI Growth Architects" focusing on:
- Get Found (SEO, visibility)
- Get Known (content, social proof)
- Get Chosen (funnels, conversion)

**Potential areas of collaboration:**

1. **SEO/Local visibility optimization** – Ranking for target keywords
2. **Paid ad management** – If I want to outsource Google/LinkedIn ads
3. **Lead gen automation** – Automated follow-up sequences
4. **Sales funnel optimization** – Improving trial-to-paid conversion
5. **Content distribution** – Amplifying reach beyond organic

**Questions for Trip:**
- What's your typical engagement look like for an early-stage SaaS?
- Do you work on performance (pay-for-results) or retainer basis?
- What's the minimum budget you recommend for paid acquisition?
- How do you approach SEO for a new domain with low authority?

---

## What Makes This Plan Work

### 1. Founder-Led First
The most successful solo SaaS founders (Pieter Levels, AJ at Carrd, Nathan Barry) all built distribution through personal brand first. No ads needed early on.

### 2. Content as Infrastructure
SEO and content aren't campaigns—they're infrastructure. Every blog post compounds over time. Month 6 traffic will be 10x Month 1.

### 3. Narrow → Wide
Start with one vertical (SaaS founders), dominate it, then expand. Better to own a niche than be noise in a crowd.

### 4. Speed to Learning
The goal isn't perfection—it's learning fast. Run small tests, measure everything, double down on winners.

### 5. Community Over Ads
In 2025/2026, community-driven growth beats paid acquisition for early-stage SaaS. Trust > impressions.

---

## TL;DR – The 90-Day Playbook

**Days 1-30:** Founder-led LinkedIn content, direct outreach to 100 targets, community seeding, build demo transcript library

**Days 31-60:** Product Hunt launch, publish first case studies, SEO blog posts begin, email list building with lead magnets

**Days 61-90:** Small paid ads test ($1k), partnership outreach, first integration (Zapier), video content

**Success = $15k MRR by Day 90**
