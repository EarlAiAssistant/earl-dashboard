**Current Status:** Launched and live. Initial outreach completed via LinkedIn posts, Facebook, and Indiana startup network.

**Goal:** Scale from early traction to $15k MRR (Month 3) → $80k MRR (Month 12)

---

## What Voxify Actually Does

### Core Product
Upload a customer call transcript → Get 4 types of marketing content:

1. **Website Copy** – Landing pages, hero sections, feature descriptions, CTAs
2. **Email Drafts** – Nurture sequences using customer language  
3. **Social Posts** – LinkedIn and Twitter content ready to publish
4. **FAQ Answers** – Real objections addressed with authentic responses

### Key Value Props
- **60 seconds, not 6 hours** – Upload transcript, get complete content pack
- **Your customers' actual words** – Not generic AI copy, but language extracted from real conversations
- **~20+ pieces per transcript** – One call fuels weeks of content

### Pricing Tiers
| Tier | Price | Generations/Month | Best For |
|------|-------|-------------------|----------|
| Starter | $29/mo | 10 | Solo consultants & coaches |
| Professional | $79/mo | 30 | Growing teams & agencies |
| Business | $199/mo | 100 | High-volume operations |

### Supported Call Types
Sales calls, support calls, demos, interviews, testimonials, coaching sessions

---

## Competitive Positioning

### What We're NOT Selling
❌ "Another AI writing tool" (commoditized, crowded)

### What We ARE Selling
✅ "Turn customer conversations into marketing content in 60 seconds—using their actual words"

### Competitive Wedge
| Competitor | What They Do | Why Voxify Wins |
|------------|--------------|-----------------|
| **ChatGPT** | Generic AI writing (prompts required) | We extract specific language from YOUR conversations—no prompt engineering |
| **Jasper** | AI writing ($49/mo, no transcription) | Purpose-built for conversations, not generic copy |
| **Otter.ai** | Transcription only | We go 10 steps further—transcription is just the input |
| **Copy.ai** | Template-based AI copy | Customer-voice content vs generic marketing speak |

### Unique Value Proposition
> "ChatGPT writes generic copy from prompts. Voxify extracts YOUR customers' specific language, pain points, and objections from real conversations—then generates content using THEIR words."

3. **Process posts:** "Here's exactly how I turn one 30-minute call into 3 weeks of content"

**Twitter/X Strategy:**

## What Trip (Xaris) Could Help With

Based on Xaris's "Get Found, Get Known, Get Chosen" positioning:

**Potential collaboration areas:**

1. **SEO/Visibility** – Ranking for target keywords faster
2. **Paid ad management** – If you want to outsource Google/LinkedIn ads
3. **Lead gen automation** – Automated follow-up sequences
4. **Funnel optimization** – Improving trial-to-paid conversion
5. **Content distribution** – Amplifying reach

**Questions for Trip:**
- What does a typical engagement look like for an early-stage SaaS?
- Performance-based or retainer pricing?
- What's the minimum budget you recommend for paid acquisition?
- How do you approach SEO for a newer domain?
- What results have you seen for similar B2B SaaS products?

---

## Why This Plan Works

### 1. Founder-Led First
Most successful bootstrapped SaaS founders built distribution through personal brand before paid ads. Your authentic voice and story are your biggest assets right now.

### 2. Content as Infrastructure
SEO and content compound over time. Every blog post is an asset that keeps working. Month 6 traffic will be 10x Month 1.

### 3. Narrow → Wide
Start with one vertical (consultants/coaches who do customer calls), dominate it, then expand.

### 4. Speed to Learning
Run small tests, measure everything, double down on winners. Kill what doesn't work fast.

---

## TL;DR

**Current state:** Launched, initial outreach done, need systematic growth

**Next 30 days:** Founder-led LinkedIn (3-4x/week), direct outreach to 100 targets, document first case studies

**Days 31-60:** SEO blog posts, email list building, optimize trial conversion

**Days 61-90:** Small paid ads test ($1k), partnership outreach, video content

**Success = $15k MRR by Day 90**
