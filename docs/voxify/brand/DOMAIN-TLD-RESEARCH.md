## Key Insights

### 1. TLD Credibility Hierarchy (for SaaS)
```
.com > .ai (for AI) > .io (for dev tools) > .app > .co > .so > others
```

### 2. Audience Matters

| Audience | Best TLDs |
|----------|-----------|
| **Developers** | .io, .dev, .sh |
| **AI/Tech** | .ai, .io |
| **General B2B** | .com, .io, .co |
| **Consumer** | .com, .app, .co |

### 3. What Makes Non-.com Work

1. **Short name** - "linear.app" works because "linear" is short
2. **Memorable** - Easy to say and spell
3. **TLD matches product** - .ai for AI, .io for tech
4. **Consistent branding** - Use everywhere, own it

### 4. Successful Pattern

Many companies:
1. Launch with alternative TLD (cheaper, available)
2. Build brand recognition
3. Acquire .com later if needed (or don't bother)

**Examples:**
- Notion: notion.so → notion.com
- Stripe: stripe.cc → stripe.com (very early)
- Most .io companies: Never bothered getting .com

## Recommendations for Voxify

### If Targeting AI/Tech Users:
**voxify.ai** would be IDEAL if available (signals AI product)

### If Targeting General B2B:
**getvoxify.com** or **voxify.io** are both solid

### Tier List for Voxify:

| Rank | Domain | Why |
|------|--------|-----|
| 1 | voxify.ai | Perfect for AI product (check availability) |
| 2 | getvoxify.com | .com credibility, proven pattern |
| 3 | voxify.io | Dev/SaaS credibility, very accepted |
| 4 | voxify.app | Modern, clean |
| 5 | tryvoxify.com | Action-oriented .com |

---

## The Bottom Line

**.io and .ai are completely legitimate for B2B SaaS.** 

Linear ($400M+), Prisma, Fly.io, and many YC companies use .io without issues. For an AI product like Voxify, **.ai would actually be BETTER** than a modified .com because it signals exactly what you are.

If voxify.ai is available, that's the best choice.
