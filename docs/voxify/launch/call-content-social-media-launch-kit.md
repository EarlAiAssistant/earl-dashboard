## Product Hunt Launch

### Main Launch Post

**Headline:**
Call-Content – Turn customer calls into complete marketing campaigns in 10 minutes

**Tagline:**
Upload a transcript. Get 12 marketing assets. No prompts, no copy-paste, just content.

**First Comment (Founder Introduction):**
```
Hey Product Hunt! 👋

I'm Drew, and I built Call-Content to solve a problem I had as a consultant: turning amazing customer calls into marketing content took forever.

The workflow looked like this:
1. Have great customer call → 1 hour
2. Transcribe it (Otter) → 30 minutes
3. Open ChatGPT, paste transcript → 5 minutes
4. Prompt engineer case study → 20 minutes
5. Repeat for social posts, email, blog → 2 hours
6. Fix brand voice inconsistencies → 30 minutes
**Total: 4+ hours** (and I'd usually just... not do it)

Call-Content collapses this to:
1. Upload transcript → 30 seconds
2. Generate 12 assets → 10 minutes
**Total: 10 minutes**

What you get:
✅ Case study (800 words)
✅ Testimonial (3 versions)
✅ LinkedIn post
✅ Twitter thread (5 tweets)
✅ Email nurture sequence (3 emails)
✅ Sales one-pager
✅ FAQ section
✅ Blog outline
✅ Pain points + solutions extract
✅ Objections + responses
✅ Feature requests summary
✅ Quote graphics (3 pull quotes)

All in your brand voice. All ready to use.

Would love your feedback! Try it free for 14 days (no credit card required).

What's the #1 type of content you wish you had more of from customer calls?

**What Makes This Product Hunt Post Work:**
- Starts with relatable pain (the 4-hour workflow)
- Shows dramatic transformation (4 hours → 10 min)
- Lists specific deliverables (builds trust)
- Ends with question (drives engagement)
- Humble tone (not salesy)

## Twitter/X Launch Thread

### Thread 1: Problem-Solution

```
🧵 I used to dread turning customer calls into content.

Every great interview would sit in my "someday" folder forever.

So I built Call-Content to fix it. Here's how it works: (1/8)

---

The old way:
✅ Great customer call (1 hour)
😰 Transcribe manually (30 min)
😰 Write case study (2 hours)
😰 Create social posts (1 hour)
😰 Write email sequence (1 hour)
😰 Give up halfway through

Total time: 5+ hours (if you even finish)
(2/8)

---

The problem? Every step requires context switching:

• Otter for transcription
• ChatGPT for writing
• Google Docs for editing
• Canva for graphics
• Email tool for sequences

By step 3, I've lost momentum. (3/8)

---

Call-Content collapses this to ONE step:

1. Upload your transcript
2. Click "Generate Campaign"
3. Get 12 ready-to-use assets in 10 minutes

That's it. (4/8)

---

What you get from ONE customer call:

📄 800-word case study
💬 3 testimonial versions
📱 LinkedIn + Twitter posts
📧 3-email nurture sequence
📊 Sales one-pager
❓ FAQ section from their questions
📝 Blog post outline
🎯 Pain points + objections
✨ Pull quotes for graphics

(5/8)

---

The secret? Templates built specifically for CUSTOMER CONVERSATIONS.

Not generic blog posts. Not social media fluff.

Templates optimized for:
• User interviews
• Success stories
• Discovery calls
• Feedback sessions
• Sales calls

(6/8)

---

Real results:

Before Call-Content:
• 2-3 case studies/year (when I could find time)
• Marketing felt like a chore
• Customer insights gathering dust

After Call-Content:
• 2-3 case studies/MONTH (20 min each)
• Content pipeline never empty
• Every call becomes marketing fuel

(7/8)

### Thread 2: "I Built This for Me" Story

```
🧵 I built Call-Content because I was embarrassed.

I had 47 customer interviews sitting on my hard drive.

FORTY-SEVEN.

Zero case studies. Zero social posts. Zero blog content.

Here's what I learned: (1/7)

---

The problem wasn't lack of content.

It was lack of TIME.

Each customer call was a goldmine:
• Pain points
• Success stories
• Objections + responses
• Feature requests
• Quotable moments

But turning that into marketing? 3-4 hours minimum. (2/7)

---

So I'd do what every busy founder does:

"I'll write that case study this weekend"
"I'll turn that into social posts next week"
"I'll definitely write that blog post... eventually"

Narrator: He never did. (3/7)

---

The breaking point:

A customer told me:
"This saved us $50k last year and 200+ hours."

I replied:
"Can I turn this into a case study?"

She said yes.

That was 8 months ago.

I still haven't written it.

🤦‍♂️ (4/7)

---

So I built Call-Content with one rule:

**It has to be FASTER than my excuses.**

Upload transcript → Get content in 10 min → No more excuses.

No prompts to engineer.
No copy-paste hell.
No "I'll do it later."

Just: Upload. Generate. Done. (5/7)

---

Now that 8-month-old interview?

Turned into:
✅ Case study (published on site)
✅ LinkedIn post (got 47 comments)
✅ Email to prospects (3 demos booked)
✅ Sales one-pager (sent to 12 leads)

Total time: 12 minutes.

ROI: Priceless. (6/7)

If you have customer interviews collecting dust...

You don't have a content problem.
You have a workflow problem.

## LinkedIn Posts

### LinkedIn Post 1: Professional/Data-Driven

```
I analyzed 100+ B2B SaaS companies.

94% do customer interviews.
11% publish case studies from them.

That's an 83% content gap.

Here's why (and how to fix it):

→ Time: Turning interviews into content takes 3-4 hours
→ Skill: Writing compelling case studies requires copywriting chops
→ Process: No clear workflow = "I'll do it later" (never happens)

The cost? MASSIVE.

Every unpublished customer interview is:
• Lost social proof (no testimonials)
• Lost SEO content (no blog posts)
• Lost sales assets (no case studies)
• Lost email content (no success stories)

What if you could change that?

Call-Content turns customer transcripts into 12 marketing assets in 10 minutes:
✅ Case study
✅ Testimonials
✅ LinkedIn/Twitter posts
✅ Email sequences
✅ Sales one-pagers
✅ Blog outlines
✅ FAQ sections

Same interview. 10 minutes. Complete marketing campaign.

P.S. If you're doing customer interviews but not publishing content from them, you're doing the hard part (getting the call) but skipping the ROI (turning it into marketing).

What's stopping you from publishing more customer stories? 👇
```

**What Makes This LinkedIn Post Work:**
- Data-driven hook (94% vs 11%)
- Clear problem breakdown
- ROI-focused (lost opportunities)
- Professional tone (B2B audience)
- Specific deliverables
- Question at end (drives comments)

---

### LinkedIn Post 2: Story-Driven

```
Last week, I had the best customer call of the year.

She told me:
"This tool saved me 200 hours and helped us close $150k in new business."

I asked: "Can I feature this as a case study?"

She said: "Absolutely."

Then I stared at my Google Doc for 3 hours and wrote nothing.

Sound familiar?

---

Here's the thing:

Getting customer interviews is HARD.
- Finding the right customer
- Scheduling around their calendar
- Asking the right questions
- Capturing genuine stories

But turning them into content? Even harder.
- Transcribing the call (30-60 min)
- Pulling out key quotes (30 min)
- Writing the narrative (2-3 hours)
- Designing graphics (1 hour)
- Editing for brand voice (30 min)

Total: 5-7 hours (if you actually finish).

Most of us don't. The interview gets filed away. Forever.

---

I built Call-Content to fix this.

One upload. 10 minutes. 12 marketing assets:
• Case study (800 words)
• Testimonial pull quotes (3 versions)
• LinkedIn post (ready to share)
• Twitter thread (5 tweets)
• Email sequence (3 nurture emails)
• Sales one-pager (for proposals)
• FAQ section (objections + responses)
• Blog outline (for long-form content)

Same great interview. Actually published this time.

---

That customer story from last week?

• Published case study on our site (150 visitors in 3 days)
• LinkedIn post (83 likes, 12 comments, 1 inbound demo)
• Email to prospects (4 responses, 2 booked calls)
• Sales deck slide (sent to 9 leads)

Total time: 11 minutes.

ROI: Immediate.

## Reddit Posts

### r/Entrepreneur Post

```
Title: I built a tool to turn customer interviews into marketing content (10 min vs. 4 hours)

Body:

Hey r/Entrepreneur,

I'm a solo founder who got tired of customer interviews sitting on my hard drive doing nothing.

The problem: Turning a 1-hour customer call into a case study, social posts, email sequences, etc. took 3-4 hours. So I'd just... not do it.

The solution: I built Call-Content to automate 90% of it.

**How it works:**
1. Upload your customer interview transcript (or use built-in transcription)
2. Click "Generate Campaign"
3. Get 12 marketing assets in ~10 minutes

**What you get:**
- 800-word case study
- 3 testimonial versions
- LinkedIn post
- Twitter thread
- 3-email sequence
- Sales one-pager
- FAQ section
- Blog outline
- Pain points/solutions summary
- Objections/responses
- Pull quotes for graphics

**Why it's different from ChatGPT:**
- No prompt engineering (templates built for customer calls)
- Brand voice consistency (set once, applies to everything)
- One-click workflow (no copy-paste between tools)
- Optimized for specific outputs (case studies, not generic blog posts)

**Early results (beta users):**
- Average time: 11 minutes (vs. 3-4 hours manual)
- 4.2 pieces of content actually published (vs. 0.3 before)
- Avg. 73% time savings

**Pricing:**
- Free 14-day trial (no credit card)
- $27/month (Starter: 20 transcripts)
- $47/month (Professional: 50 transcripts)

Try it: [link]

**Question for the community:**
How many customer interviews have YOU done that never turned into content? I had 47 before I built this. 😅

Not here to spam—genuinely curious if this resonates with other founders.

---

Edit: Wow, didn't expect this response! Common questions:

Q: Does it work with non-English transcripts?
A: Yes! Supports 50+ languages.

Q: Can I customize the outputs?
A: Yes, every template is editable + you can set brand voice/tone.

Q: What if my call is on Zoom/Google Meet?
A: Upload the recording and we'll transcribe it, or paste the transcript from Otter/Fireflies.
```

**What Makes This Reddit Post Work:**
- Humble, non-salesy tone (Reddit hates marketing)
- Specific, honest numbers (builds trust)
- Clear problem/solution
- Addresses objections upfront
- Asks genuine question (not just "check out my thing")
- Edit with FAQ shows responsiveness

---

### r/SaaS Post

```
Title: [Feedback] Built a SaaS to turn customer calls into marketing assets—thoughts?

Body:

Context: I'm a developer who hated how long it took to turn customer interviews into case studies, social posts, etc. Built Call-Content to solve it.

**The problem I'm solving:**
Most SaaS founders do customer interviews but don't publish the content because it's too time-consuming (3-4 hours per interview).

**My solution:**
Upload transcript → AI generates 12 marketing assets in 10 minutes (case study, testimonials, social posts, emails, sales deck slides, etc.)

**Tech stack:**
- Next.js + TypeScript (frontend)
- Supabase (DB + auth)
- OpenAI GPT-4 (content generation)
- Stripe (billing)
- AssemblyAI (optional transcription)

**Pricing:**
- Starter: $27/month (20 transcripts)
- Professional: $47/month (50 transcripts)
- Agency: $97/month (200 transcripts + team features)

**Early traction (first 2 weeks):**
- 23 trial signups
- 4 paid conversions (17% trial-to-paid)
- $127 MRR
- Avg. time saved per user: 3.2 hours/week

**Questions for r/SaaS:**

1. **Pricing:** Is $27/month too low for this much value? (Some users say it should be $99/month)
2. **Positioning:** Am I competing with Otter.ai (transcription) or Jasper (AI writing)? Or is this a new category?
3. **Distribution:** Best channels for reaching consultants/SaaS founders? (tried Reddit, Indie Hackers, Twitter)
4. **Churn risk:** Worried about "seasonal" use (interview season, then nothing). How to build habit?

**Link:** [Removed to follow r/SaaS rules—DM if interested]

Honest feedback appreciated! Not looking for roasts, but genuinely curious what experienced SaaS folks think.
```

**What Makes This Reddit Post Work:**
- Transparent (shares numbers, tech stack)
- Asks for genuine feedback (not just promoting)
- Shows traction (builds credibility)
- Follows subreddit rules (no direct link in post)
- Humble tone (open to criticism)

## Indie Hackers Post

```
Title: Turned my "ugh, I'll do it later" problem into a $127 MRR SaaS (2 weeks in)

Body:

**The "ugh" moment:**

I had 47 customer interviews on my hard drive.

Zero case studies published.

Every time I'd finish a great call, I'd think: "I should turn this into content."

Then I'd open Google Docs... and close it 5 minutes later.

Rinse, repeat, give up.

---

**Why it was so painful:**

Turning one customer call into marketing content looked like this:

1. Transcribe call (Otter.ai): 30 min
2. Read transcript, take notes: 20 min
3. Write case study: 2 hours
4. Create social posts: 1 hour
5. Write email sequence: 1 hour
6. Design quote graphics: 30 min

**Total: 5+ hours**

For. One. Interview.

So I'd just... not do it. And feel guilty about wasted potential.

---

**The solution I built:**

Call-Content = Upload transcript → Get 12 marketing assets in 10 min

What it generates:
- Case study (800 words)
- 3 testimonial versions
- LinkedIn/Twitter posts
- 3-email sequence
- Sales one-pager
- FAQ section
- Blog outline
- Pain points/solutions
- Objections/responses
- Pull quotes

All in your brand voice. All ready to use (or edit).

---

**Tech stack:**
- Frontend: Next.js + TypeScript
- Backend: Supabase (Postgres + Auth)
- AI: OpenAI GPT-4 (via API)
- Payments: Stripe
- Hosting: Vercel

Build time: 6 weeks (nights/weekends)

---

**Launch strategy:**

1. Product Hunt (scored #4 Product of the Day)
2. Reddit (r/Entrepreneur, r/SaaS)
3. Indie Hackers (this post!)
4. Twitter (small following, limited traction)

---

**Early results (14 days):**

- 23 trial signups
- 4 paid conversions (17% trial-to-paid so far)
- $127 MRR
- $0 ad spend (all organic)

**Pricing:**
- Starter: $27/month (20 transcripts)
- Pro: $47/month (50 transcripts)
- Agency: $97/month (200 transcripts)

---

**What's working:**

✅ Problem resonates (almost everyone has "unpublished interviews")
✅ 10-min demo = immediate value (vs. ChatGPT guesswork)
✅ Pricing feels like a "no-brainer" (vs. $67 Jasper+Otter combo)

**What's NOT working:**

❌ Churn risk (users interview seasonally, not monthly)
❌ Hard to explain in 1 sentence (is it transcription? AI writing? content tool?)
❌ Small TAM worry (how many people do interviews regularly?)

---

**Questions for IH community:**

1. How do I prevent seasonal churn? (interview season → cancel → re-subscribe later)
2. Should I pivot to annual pricing? (vs. monthly)
3. Is $27/month leaving money on the table? (users say it's "insanely cheap")
4. Best way to reach consultants/coaches? (my ideal customer)

---

**Lessons so far:**

1. **Solve your own problem** → Built this because I needed it, turns out others do too
2. **Launch fast** → Took 6 weeks, could've done 3 (over-engineered early features)
3. **Price for value, not cost** → Almost priced at $9/month (yikes)
4. **Reddit > Twitter** (for early traction, at least for me)

---

Would love feedback from folks who've scaled past $1k MRR. What should I focus on next?
```

**What Makes This Indie Hackers Post Work:**
- Personal, vulnerable story (the "ugh" moment)
- Transparent numbers (MRR, conversions, timeline)
- Shows real uncertainty (churn risk, pricing questions)
- Asks for specific help (not just promoting)
- Follows IH culture (builders helping builders)

## Engagement Response Templates

### When someone asks "How is this different from ChatGPT?"

```
Great question! ChatGPT is incredibly powerful, but it's a blank canvas.

Call-Content is a *workflow*:
- Pre-built templates for 12 content types
- One-click generation (vs. multiple prompts)
- Brand voice consistency
- Optimized for customer conversations (not generic)

Think: ChatGPT = Photoshop (can do anything), Call-Content = Canva (does one thing perfectly).

Want to try it? 14-day free trial: [link]
```

---

### When someone asks about pricing

```
Totally fair question!

We tested $9, $27, $47, and $97/month with beta users.

$27 hit the sweet spot:
- Cheaper than alternatives (Jasper+Otter = $66/month)
- Expensive enough to feel valuable
- Low barrier for solopreneurs/consultants

That said, we might introduce a $99/month "Pro" tier with unlimited transcripts based on feedback.

Does $27/month feel right for 20 transcripts + 12 assets each? Or too low?
```

---

### When someone says "I'll try it later"

```
Totally get it! 

If you want, I can email you a reminder in a week when you're less busy?

Or if you have 5 min right now—try one of our demo transcripts (no signup required): [link]

You can see the quality of output immediately without uploading anything.

Either way, appreciate you checking it out! 🙏
```
