### Thread 1: "How We Built Voxify" (Founder Story)
```
🧵 I spent 3 hours listening to a sales call, taking notes, trying to capture how customers describe their problems.

The copy I wrote using that research? 3x better conversions.

But 3 hours per project doesn't scale. Here's what I built instead:

---

The problem: businesses have HOURS of customer calls sitting unused.

Sales demos. Discovery calls. Coaching sessions.

Each one contains marketing gold—the exact words customers use to describe their pain.

But extracting that language manually? 2-3 hours per call.

---

So it never happens.

Instead, copywriters guess. Marketers use industry jargon. Websites sound like every competitor.

And the actual voice of the customer? Locked in recordings nobody watches.

---

I built @getvoxify to fix this.

Upload a transcript → get marketing content in 60 seconds.

Website copy. Email sequences. Social posts. FAQs.

All using the customer's actual language.

---

Here's what it extracts:
• Pain points (→ headlines)
• Objections (→ FAQ content)
• Success language (→ testimonials)
• Emotional triggers (→ email hooks)

One 45-minute call = 20+ pieces of content.

---

The secret? AI doesn't just summarize—it identifies the phrases that convert.

"I'm drowning in spreadsheets" hits different than "automated data processing."

Voxify finds those phrases and builds content around them.

### Thread 3: "Corporate Jargon vs Customer Language"
```
Corporate: "Streamlined workflow optimization"

Customer: "I stop working at midnight instead of 3am"

Which one converts? 🧵

---

HEADLINE EXAMPLES:

❌ "Revolutionary project management solution"
✅ "Stop losing projects in email chains"

❌ "Enterprise-grade scalability"  
✅ "Works the same with 10 users or 10,000"

---

FEATURE DESCRIPTIONS:

❌ "Automated data synchronization"
✅ "Change it once, it updates everywhere"

❌ "Intuitive user interface"
✅ "Takes 5 minutes to learn, not 5 weeks"

---

EMAIL SUBJECT LINES:

❌ "Maximize your team's productivity"
✅ "The Excel nightmare ends here"

❌ "Transform your operations"
✅ "What if reports wrote themselves?"

---

CTA BUTTONS:

❌ "Get Started"
✅ "Stop the chaos"

❌ "Learn More"
✅ "See how it works in 60 seconds"

---

The pattern:

Corporate = what you DO
Customer = what they FEEL

Features vs. feelings.
Jargon vs. relief.

---

The best copy comes from listening to actual customers.

Not focus groups. Not surveys.

Real calls. Real problems. Real language.

@getvoxify extracts this automatically from your call transcripts.

### Post 1: Story Format
```
I used to charge clients $3,000 for "voice of customer research."

Here's what that actually meant:

• Listen to 10 hours of sales calls
• Take notes on customer language
• Identify pain points and objections
• Find the phrases that resonate

It took 2-3 weeks.

Last month, I ran that same process through Voxify.

60 seconds.

Same insights. Same customer language. Same conversion-boosting copy.

I'm not saying AI replaces the copywriter.

But it absolutely replaces the 2 weeks of transcription and note-taking.

Now I spend that time on what matters: strategy and creative.

If you've got customer calls sitting unused, you're sitting on a goldmine.

#copywriting #marketing #ai
```

### Post 2: Hot Take Format
```
Hot take: Most B2B websites sound exactly the same because they're all copying each other instead of listening to their customers.

"Transform your business"
"Innovative solutions"  
"Streamlined workflows"

These phrases mean nothing.

You know what actually converts?

"I used to spend my entire Sunday on payroll"

That's real. That's specific. That's from a customer call.

Your customers are already telling you how to sell to them.

You just need to listen.

We built Voxify to automate this.

Upload a transcript → get marketing content using your customers' actual words.

### Post 3: Tactical Post
```
Here's a free copywriting hack that'll 3x your landing page conversions:

Stop writing about your product.
Start quoting your customers.

Before: "Our platform automates time-consuming manual processes"

After: "I got my Sundays back" - Sarah, Operations Manager

Before: "Comprehensive analytics dashboard"

After: "I finally know what's working and what's not" - Mike, Marketing Director

The secret? Record your sales calls.

Then mine them for the exact phrases customers use to describe:
• Their problem (→ your headlines)
• What they want (→ your benefits)
• Why they're hesitant (→ your FAQ)

One 30-minute call can fuel a month of content.

What's stopping you?

### Post 4: Contrarian Post
```
Controversial opinion:

You don't need a copywriter.

You need a better way to listen to your customers.

The best headlines I've ever written weren't written—they were discovered.

Hidden in sales calls.
Buried in support tickets.
Sitting unused in Gong recordings.

"I haven't slept through the night in 6 months"
"I feel like I'm failing my team every day"
"It's like trying to bail out the Titanic with a teaspoon"

These aren't made up. They're real quotes from real customers.

No copywriter could invent language this authentic.

The job isn't to create compelling copy.

It's to find it.
