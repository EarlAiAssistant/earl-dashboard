## Full Description (Gallery Text)

### The Problem
You have hours of customer calls sitting unused. Discovery calls, sales demos, coaching sessions—each one contains marketing gold: the exact words your customers use to describe their problems.

But extracting that language manually? It takes 2-3 hours per call. So it doesn't happen, and your marketing ends up using corporate jargon instead of customer language.

### The Solution
Voxify turns any call transcript into ready-to-use marketing content in 60 seconds:

✨ **Website Copy** — Headlines, hero sections, about pages using customer language
📧 **Email Sequences** — Welcome series, nurture emails, conversion sequences  
📱 **Social Posts** — LinkedIn, Twitter, and Facebook content
❓ **FAQ Sections** — Real objections answered in customer words

### How It Works
1. Upload a transcript (paste text or upload file)
2. AI extracts pain points, objections, and customer language
3. Get 15-25 pieces of content, ready to use

### Who It's For
- **Copywriters** — Faster client onboarding, authentic voice extraction
- **Agencies** — Scale content production without scaling headcount
- **Coaches** — Turn coaching calls into content systems
- **SaaS Founders** — Ship landing pages that convert

### Pricing
- Starter: $29/mo (10 transcripts)
- Professional: $79/mo (30 transcripts)
- Business: $199/mo (100 transcripts)

14-day free trial. No credit card required.

## Maker's First Comment

Hey Product Hunt! 👋

Drew here, maker of Voxify.

**Why I built this:**

I was helping a SaaS founder with their landing page last year. We spent 3 hours listening to his sales calls, taking notes, trying to capture how his customers actually described their problems.

The copy we wrote using that research? It converted 3x better than the original.

But 3 hours per project isn't scalable. So I built Voxify to do that extraction automatically.

**What makes it different:**

Most AI writing tools start from a blank prompt. Voxify starts from *your actual customer conversations*. The output isn't generic—it's built on what your specific customers said.

**What I'd love feedback on:**
- Is the output quality good enough to use directly, or does it need more polish?
- What content types would you add? (We're considering case studies and video scripts)
- Would you pay for this? At what price point?

Launch special: Comment "LAUNCH" and I'll extend your trial to 30 days.

Let's chat! 🚀
