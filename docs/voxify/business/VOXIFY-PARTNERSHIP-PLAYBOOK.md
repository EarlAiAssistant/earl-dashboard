### Pitch Template: Integration Partner

**Subject:** Integration opportunity: [Their Product] + Voxify

```
Hi [Name],

I'm Drew, founder of Voxify. We turn customer call transcripts into marketing content (website copy, emails, social posts, FAQs) automatically.

I think there's a natural fit with [Their Product]:

**The user journey:**
1. User records call with [Their Product]
2. [Their Product] creates transcript
3. User uploads to Voxify → gets marketing content

**The opportunity:**
- Add value for your users who want to do more with their transcripts
- Differentiate from competitors with content creation workflow
- Potential for revenue share or joint marketing

**What I'm proposing:**
A simple integration where users can export directly to Voxify, or a partnership where we recommend each other to relevant customers.

Would you be open to a 15-minute call to explore this?

Hi [Name],

Following up on my note about a potential Voxify + [Their Product] integration.

Happy to share more details on what the integration could look like and the user value.

Worth a quick chat?

**Day 14 (final follow-up):**
```
Hi [Name],

Last note on this—don't want to be annoying.

### Pitch Template: Podcast Guest

**Subject:** Podcast topic: The goldmine in your customer calls

```
Hi [Name],

Love [Podcast Name] — especially the episode with [specific guest].

I have a topic I think your listeners would dig:

**"The goldmine in your customer calls"**

The premise: Every customer conversation contains the exact language that converts—pain points, objections, results. But most businesses never extract it.

I built Voxify to solve this (transcript → content in 60 seconds), and I have stories + data on:
- Why customer language converts better than copywriting
- The hidden content in calls people already have
- How AI is changing content extraction (not generation)

I can make it tactical with examples your listeners can apply immediately.

Worth considering for an episode?

Founder, Voxify
