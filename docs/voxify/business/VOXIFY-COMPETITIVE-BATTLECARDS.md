## Card 1: vs ChatGPT / Claude / Generic AI

### Their Positioning
"I can just use ChatGPT—it's cheaper and does everything."

### Acknowledge
"ChatGPT is incredibly powerful. For one-off tasks with custom prompts, it's great."

### Differentiate

| Factor | ChatGPT | Voxify |
|--------|---------|--------|
| Workflow | Prompt → Output → New Prompt | One-click, all content types |
| Time per transcript | 30-60 minutes | 60 seconds |
| Prompt expertise required | Yes | No |
| Output consistency | Varies by prompt | Consistent structure |
| Customer-voice focus | Generic | Purpose-built |

### Key Points

1. **Time math:** "If you value your time at $75/hour, spending 45 minutes in ChatGPT costs you $56 in time. Voxify costs $29/month and takes 60 seconds."

2. **Consistency:** "With ChatGPT, output quality depends on your prompt. One day it's great, next day it's generic. Voxify is consistent every time."

3. **Workflow vs tool:** "ChatGPT is a tool. Voxify is a workflow. We know exactly what to extract from customer conversations—you don't have to figure it out."

### Winning Question
"How many customer transcripts do you process per month? If it's more than 2-3, the time savings alone justify Voxify."

### When They Actually Fit
ChatGPT is fine if they:
- Process 1-2 transcripts per month max
- Already have great prompt templates
- Enjoy the prompting process
- Need unusual output formats we don't support

## Card 2: vs Jasper / Copy.ai

### Their Positioning
"We already use Jasper (or Copy.ai) for our content."

### Acknowledge
"Jasper is solid for general marketing copy—ads, product descriptions, blog outlines."

### Differentiate

| Factor | Jasper/Copy.ai | Voxify |
|--------|---------------|--------|
| Input type | Text prompts | Customer transcripts |
| Source material | You provide context | Customers provide context |
| Voice | Generic "marketing speak" | Your customers' actual words |
| Use case | Broad content creation | Customer conversation → content |
| Transcription | Not included | Works with any transcript |

### Key Points

1. **Different jobs:** "Jasper writes copy FROM scratch. Voxify extracts copy FROM conversations. They're complementary—Jasper for ads and landing pages, Voxify for authentic customer-voice content."

2. **Authenticity:** "Jasper generates 'marketing speak.' Voxify captures how your customers actually talk. Which converts better?"

3. **Source of truth:** "The best marketing copy comes from customers. Jasper invents language. Voxify extracts language."

### Winning Question
"Where does your best converting copy come from—things you've written, or things customers have said?"

### When They Actually Fit
Jasper/Copy.ai is fine if they:
- Need high-volume ad copy
- Don't have customer conversations to mine
- Want AI to generate from scratch, not extract

## Card 3: vs Otter.ai / Fireflies / Fathom

### Their Positioning
"We already use Otter for transcription and summaries."

### Acknowledge
"Otter is great for transcription—probably the best in the market for accuracy."

### Differentiate

| Factor | Otter/Fireflies | Voxify |
|--------|----------------|--------|
| Primary function | Transcription + summaries | Content creation |
| Output | Meeting notes, action items | Marketing content |
| Use case | Internal documentation | External marketing |
| Goes beyond transcript | Summary, highlights | Website copy, emails, social |

### Key Points

1. **We're the next step:** "Otter transcribes. We create. Use Otter to get the transcript, then upload to Voxify to turn it into marketing content."

2. **Different outcomes:** "Otter gives you a record of what was said. Voxify gives you content you can publish."

3. **Integration potential:** "They're not competitors—they're complements. Otter captures, Voxify converts."

### Winning Question
"After Otter gives you the transcript—what happens next? How do you turn those conversations into marketing material?"

### When They Actually Fit
Otter/Fireflies is the right choice if they:
- Only need internal meeting notes
- Don't plan to create marketing content from calls
- Want live transcription during meetings

## Card 4: vs Manual Process / Freelancers

### Their Positioning
"We just do it ourselves" or "We hire freelance writers for case studies."

### Acknowledge
"Manual extraction works. And good writers can create excellent case studies."

### Differentiate

| Factor | Manual / Freelance | Voxify |
|--------|-------------------|--------|
| Time per case study | 4-8 hours | 1 hour (including review) |
| Cost per case study | $500-2,000 (freelance) | $29-79/month (unlimited) |
| Speed | Days to weeks | Minutes |
| Customer language | Often "professionalized" | Preserved exactly |
| Scales | Doesn't (time-limited) | Does (same time for 1 or 10) |

### Key Points

1. **Economics:** "A freelance case study costs $500-2,000. Voxify costs $29/month. Do the math."

2. **Authenticity loss:** "When a writer 'cleans up' customer language, they often lose what made it powerful. Voxify preserves the exact words."

3. **Scale:** "You can manually extract content from 1-2 calls per month. Can you do 10? 20? Voxify scales; your time doesn't."

4. **Opportunity cost:** "Every hour spent extracting content is an hour not spent on something else. What's that hour worth?"

### Winning Question
"How many customer calls per month do you have that COULD become content—versus how many actually DO become content?"

### When They Actually Fit
Manual/freelance is fine if they:
- Have 1-2 high-stakes case studies per year (worth custom treatment)
- Have in-house writers with extra capacity
- Need extremely customized output

## Card 5: vs "We Don't Do Customer Interviews"

### Their Positioning
"We don't really do customer calls / interviews."

### Probe First

"What about:
- Sales calls?
- Onboarding calls?
- Support conversations?
- Success check-ins?
- Discovery calls?"

Usually, they DO have conversations—they just don't think of them as "interviews."

### Key Points

1. **Broaden the definition:** "Any conversation where a customer talks about their problems, experience, or results is content material."

2. **Start simple:** "You don't need formal interviews. A 20-minute success call works. A support ticket discussion works."

3. **The hidden goldmine:** "Most companies have dozens of customer conversations happening monthly. None of it becomes content. That's the opportunity."

### Winning Question
"If you could publish one case study per month using conversations you're already having—would that be valuable?"

---

## Card 6: vs "AI Content Doesn't Sound Authentic"

### Their Positioning
"AI-generated content always sounds robotic / generic."

### Acknowledge
"Most AI content does sound generic. That's because most AI generates FROM prompts, not FROM authentic source material."

### Differentiate

**The Voxify difference:**
- We don't generate language—we extract it
- Input: Your customer's actual words
- Output: Content using their exact phrases
- The authenticity comes from them, not from us

### Key Points

1. **Source matters:** "ChatGPT invents language based on patterns. Voxify extracts language from your specific customers. Huge difference."

2. **Show, don't tell:** "Try it with one transcript. See if the output sounds like your customers—because it uses their words."

3. **The authenticity test:** "Could you publish this without editing? Our goal is yes."

### Winning Question
"Want to try it with one transcript and see for yourself?"
