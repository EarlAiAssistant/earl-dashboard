# Voxify Networking Q&A

*Prepared for startup networking event - Feb 10, 2026*

---

## The Basics

**"What is Voxify?"**
AI-powered platform that helps businesses create marketing content faster. You describe what you need, it generates on-brand content ready to use.

**"Who's your target customer?"**
Small businesses and marketing teams who need consistent content but don't have time or budget for agencies.

**"What problem are you solving?"**
Content creation is a bottleneck. People know they need to post, email, advertise — but actually making it takes forever. We make it fast.

---

## Differentiation

**"How is this different from ChatGPT?"**
ChatGPT is a blank canvas. Voxify is purpose-built for marketing — templates, brand voice, formats ready to go. Less prompting, better output.

**"Why pay vs. using AI directly?"**
Time. You could also build your own furniture, but you buy it. We've done the prompt engineering and workflow so you don't have to.

**"What's your moat?"**
Honestly, execution and UX. The AI is a commodity — how you package it for a specific use case is what matters.

---

## Business Model

**"How do you make money?"**
Monthly subscriptions with credit-based usage. Pay for a plan, get generations each month.

**"What's your pricing?"**
[Fill in your tiers]

**"Any paying customers yet?"**
[Be honest — "Just launched" / "A few early users" / "Yes, X customers"]

---

## Traction & Stage

**"Where are you in the journey?"**
Just launched. Product is live, now focused on getting users and feedback.

**"Biggest challenge right now?"**
Distribution. Product works — now it's about getting it in front of the right people.

**"Looking for funding?"**
Open to conversations, but not actively raising. Focused on traction first.

---

## Technical

**"Tech stack?"**
Next.js, React, hosted on Vercel. Standard modern web stack.

**"Which AI models?"**
Anthropic's Claude. Better at nuanced writing and following instructions, which matters for marketing content.

**"How do you handle quality?"**
Tuned prompts, output formatting, and letting users iterate. AI gets you 80%, you polish the last 20%.

---

## Personal

**"What's your background?"**
Software engineer at FedEx, business informatics degree from IU. Been building software for a few years, wanted to create something of my own.

**"Why marketing content?"**
It's a universal pain point. Every business needs it, most hate doing it. Felt like a good fit for AI.

**"Solo or team?"**
Solo right now. Keeping it lean until there's real traction.

---

## Curveballs

**"What if OpenAI just builds this?"**
They might. But OpenAI builds platforms, not vertical products. There's room for focused tools that serve specific users well.

**"How do you see AI content evolving?"**
It'll get better and more personalized. The winners will be the ones who make it seamless and trustworthy, not just "more AI."

*Good luck! 🚀*
