- Grout float, sponges

### Wood Finishing
- **Stain:** 8 oz (half pint) - Minwax or Varathane (~$5-8)
- **Polyurethane:** Water-based satin/semi-gloss quart (~$12-18)
  - **Top picks:** Minwax Polycrylic or Varathane Water-Based

## Step-by-Step Instructions

### 1. Stain & Attach Wood Trim (Day 1-3)

**Prepare trim BEFORE attaching (easier!):**
1. Cut trim to fit around plywood perimeter
2. Apply stain, let dry 24 hours
3. Apply 3 coats water-based poly (sand lightly between coats with 220-grit)
   - Each coat dries 2-4 hours
   - This prevents grout staining later!

**Attach trim to plywood:**
1. Position trim flush or slightly proud of plywood surface (tiles should NOT sit higher than trim)
2. Pre-drill pilot holes near ends to prevent splitting
3. Nail with 16-gauge steel finish nails every 8-10 inches, angled slightly inward
4. Countersink with nail set, fill holes with wood putty, sand smooth
5. Touch up poly over filled holes

### 2. Plan & Adhere Tiles (Day 4-6)

**Layout:**
- Dry-fit tiles first to plan pattern
- Leave 1/16"-1/8" gap between tiles and trim (prevents cracking)

**Adhere:**
1. Apply construction adhesive in zigzag pattern on plywood
2. Press tiles firmly with slight twist
3. Wipe off squeezed adhesive immediately
4. **WAIT 24-48 hours before grouting** (check adhesive tube for cure time)

### 3. Grout (Day 6-7)

1. Remove spacers, scoop premixed grout onto tiles
2. Spread with grout float at 45° angle, work diagonally
3. Scrape excess with float at 90°
4. **Wipe tiles with damp sponge while grout is wet** (circular motions, rinse sponge often)
5. Let haze dry 15-30 min, buff with dry cloth

### 4. Seal Grout (Day 14)

**CRITICAL - Wait 7 days for grout to cure!**

1. Apply penetrating grout sealer (Aqua Mix or Miracle 511)
2. Use foam brush or spray, let soak 5-10 minutes
3. Wipe excess off tiles
4. Let cure 24 hours before using table
5. Prevents stains from drinks/food

## Product Recommendations

| Item | What to Buy | Price | Why |
|------|-------------|-------|-----|
| **Nails** | 2" 16-gauge steel finish nails | $3-5 | Standard for trim, won't split wood |
| **Stain** | 8 oz Minwax or Varathane | $5-8 | Smallest size (plenty for trim) |
| **Polyurethane** | Minwax Polycrylic or Varathane (water-based, satin) | $12-18 | Fast-dry, no yellowing, low odor |
| **Grout Sealer** | Aqua Mix Sealer's Choice Gold or Miracle 511 | $12-20 | Penetrating type lasts 1-2 years |

**Why these choices:**
- **16-gauge steel nails:** Perfect balance - thin enough not to split, strong enough to hold
- **Water-based poly:** Dries in 2-4 hours (vs 8-24 for oil), doesn't yellow, easy cleanup
- **Penetrating sealer:** Soaks into grout (not topical coating), looks natural, lasts longer

## Timeline & Pro Tips

**Timeline:** 2 weeks total (mostly waiting) | 8-10 hours hands-on work

- **Days 1-3:** Stain & seal trim, attach to plywood
- **Day 4:** Adhere tiles
- **Days 5-6:** Wait for adhesive to cure
- **Days 6-7:** Apply grout
- **Days 7-14:** Wait for grout to cure (7 days)
- **Day 14:** Seal grout, cure 24h
- **Day 15:** Ready to use! 🎉

**Critical Tips:**
- ✅ **Stain/seal trim BEFORE attaching** - way easier than in place
- ✅ **Don't rush adhesive cure** - tiles will shift during grouting if you do
- ✅ **Use penetrating grout sealer** - not topical coating (lasts longer, looks better)
- ✅ **Clean grout off tiles while wet** - nearly impossible once dry
- ✅ **3 coats poly minimum** - it's a table, needs durability

**Common Mistakes:**
- ❌ Grouting before adhesive cures → tiles shift
- ❌ Not sealing grout → coffee/wine stains
- ❌ Not sealing wood before tiling → grout stains wood
- ❌ Using topical grout sealer → wears off quickly

## Troubleshooting

**Trim splitting:** Pre-drill pilot holes, avoid nailing within 1" of ends  
**Tiles shifting during grouting:** Adhesive not cured - remove grout, re-adhere, wait 24h+  
**Grout staining wood:** Should've sealed first - try mineral spirits, sand/refinish if needed  
**Grout cracking:** Normal hairline cracks happen - seal anyway (fills small cracks)
