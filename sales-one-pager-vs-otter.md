### **The Real Difference: Transcription vs. Content Generation**

**Otter.ai gives you this:**
```
Speaker 1: So, um, before we started using this tool, we were, like, spending a lot of time on, you know, manual work.

Speaker 2: How much time?

Speaker 1: Probably, uh, 20 hours a week? Maybe more.
```

**Call-Content gives you this:**
> **How Acme Corp Cut Manual Work From 20 Hours to 2 Hours Per Week**
>
> Before implementing [Product], Acme Corp's team was spending 20+ hours per week on manual tasks. "We were drowning in spreadsheets," says Sarah, Head of Operations.
>
> After switching to [Product], that time dropped to just 2 hours per week — a 90% reduction.
>
> Here's how they did it...

**See the difference?** Otter transcribes. Call-Content creates polished content.

### **Use Both Together (Recommended)**

**The Power Combo:**
1. **Record your customer call** (Zoom, Google Meet, etc.)
2. **Transcribe with Otter.ai** (90-95% accuracy, real-time)
3. **Upload to Call-Content** (generate blog posts, case studies, social posts)
4. **Publish and promote**

**Workflow:**
- Otter: $16.99/month (transcription)
- Call-Content: $27/month (content generation)
- **Total:** $44/month for end-to-end solution

**ROI:** Save 10+ hours/month on content creation = $1,000+ in time savings

---

### **ROI Comparison**

**Scenario:** You interview 4 customers per month and need case studies

| Metric | Otter Alone | Otter + Call-Content |
|--------|-------------|----------------------|
| **Monthly Cost** | $16.99 | $43.99 ($16.99 + $27) |
| **Time per case study** | 4 hours (transcribe + write manually) | 45 min (transcribe + auto-generate + edit) |
| **Total time (4 case studies)** | 16 hours | 3 hours |
| **Time saved** | 0 hours | 13 hours |
| **Your hourly rate** | $100/hour | $100/hour |
| **Value of time saved** | $0 | **$1,300** |
| **ROI** | -$16.99 | $1,300 - $44 = **$1,256** |

**The combo pays for itself in the first month.**
