# HEARTBEAT.md

## Ongoing Work Check
- Check if there's active backlog work in progress (check last memory entry)
- If Drew asked me to continue working on something, resume it
- Track state in memory/heartbeat-state.json

## Status
- Last check: (timestamp gets updated each run)
- Current task: (what I'm working on)
