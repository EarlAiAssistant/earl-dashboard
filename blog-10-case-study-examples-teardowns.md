## Introduction

You've been told to write case studies. You know they convert. But when you sit down to write one, you freeze.

**"What should it look like? How long should it be? What structure works best?"**

The best way to learn is to study what already works.

- What makes them effective
- What you can steal (legally)
- What to avoid
- How to apply these lessons to your own case studies

By the end, you'll have a blueprint based on proven examples — not theory.

## How We Evaluated These Case Studies

**What we looked for:**

1. **Hook strength** (Do the first 100 words make you want to keep reading?)
2. **Specificity** (Real metrics, real names, real details)
3. **Story structure** (Problem → Solution → Results)
4. **Emotional resonance** (Does it make you feel something?)
5. **Clarity and scannability** (Can you skim it and still get value?)
6. **Call to action** (Clear next step?)
7. **Conversion potential** (Would this make you want to buy?)

**Rating scale:** ⭐ Poor | ⭐⭐ Okay | ⭐⭐⭐ Good | ⭐⭐⭐⭐ Great | ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ Exceptional

## Case Study #1: Slack + Shopify

**Company:** Slack  
**Customer:** Shopify  
**URL:** slack.com/customers/shopify  
**Overall Rating:** ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ Exceptional

---

### **The Hook**

> "Shopify reduced employee onboarding time from 2 weeks to 2 days using Slack."

**Rating:** ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐

**Why it works:**
- Immediate impact (2 weeks → 2 days is dramatic)
- Specific metric (not "faster" — actual numbers)
- Big-name customer (Shopify = instant credibility)

---

### **The Problem Section**

> "With teams distributed across 7 time zones, Shopify's biggest challenge was keeping everyone aligned. Email chains were slow, meetings were hard to schedule, and new hires felt disconnected."

**Rating:** ⭐⭐⭐⭐

**Why it works:**
- Relatable problem (distributed teams)
- Specific pain point (email chains, meetings, disconnection)
- Sets up the transformation

**What could be better:**
- Could use a direct quote from a Shopify employee here

---

### **The Solution Section**

> "Shopify implemented Slack across the entire organization. They created channels for different teams, projects, and time zones. New hires get access to all relevant channels on Day 1."

**Rating:** ⭐⭐⭐⭐

**Why it works:**
- Specific implementation details (channels, Day 1 access)
- Shows *how* they used the product, not just *that* they used it

**What could be better:**
- Missing the "why they chose Slack over alternatives"

---

### **The Results Section**

> **Results:**
> - Onboarding time: 2 weeks → 2 days
> - Team collaboration: +50% increase in cross-functional projects
> - Employee satisfaction: +35% (internal survey)

**Rating:** ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐

**Why it works:**
- Multiple metrics (not just one)
- Before/after format (easy to scan)
- Mix of hard metrics (onboarding time) and soft metrics (satisfaction)

---

### **What You Can Steal**

1. **Lead with the biggest number** ("2 weeks → 2 days")
2. **Use before/after format** for metrics
3. **Include both quantitative and qualitative results**

---

### **What to Avoid**

- Don't skip the "why they chose you" section

---

## Case Study #2: HubSpot + Trello

**Company:** HubSpot  
**Customer:** Trello  
**URL:** hubspot.com/case-studies/trello  
**Overall Rating:** ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ Exceptional

---

### **The Hook**

> "Trello had a content problem. They were publishing inconsistently, and their blog traffic was flat. Then they implemented HubSpot's content strategy framework and saw 300% growth in 6 months."

**Rating:** ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐

**Why it works:**
- Identifies with a common problem ("content problem")
- Promises a dramatic result (300% growth)
- Short timeline (6 months feels achievable)

---

### **The Problem Section**

> "We were publishing whenever we had time," says Trello's Head of Content. "Sometimes we'd publish 3 posts in a week, then nothing for a month. We had no strategy, no calendar, no accountability."

**Rating:** ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐

**Why it works:**
- Direct quote (their voice, not HubSpot's)
- Specific problem (inconsistency, no strategy)
- Relatable (most content teams face this)

---

### **The Solution Section**

> **What Trello Did:**
>
> **Month 1:** Audited existing content, identified gaps  
> **Month 2:** Built an editorial calendar (12 weeks ahead)  
> **Month 3:** Created content templates and workflows in HubSpot  
> **Month 4-6:** Published 2 posts/week consistently
>
> "The calendar was a game-changer. We finally had visibility into what was coming and could plan around it."

**Rating:** ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐

**Why it works:**
- Timeline breakdown (shows the process)
- Specific actions (editorial calendar, templates, 2 posts/week)
- Quote reinforces the key lesson (calendar = visibility)

---

### **The Results Section**

> | Metric | Before | After | Change |
> |--------|--------|-------|--------|
> | Blog traffic | 10,000/month | 40,000/month | **+300%** |
> | Leads from content | 50/month | 125/month | **+150%** |
> | Publishing consistency | Sporadic | 2/week | **Consistent** |

**Rating:** ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐

**Why it works:**
- Table format (easy to scan)
- Specific numbers (not "significant growth")
- Mix of metrics (traffic, leads, consistency)

---

### **The Key Takeaways Section**

> **What You Can Learn From Trello:**
>
> 1. **Consistency beats perfection.** Publishing regularly at B+ quality is better than occasionally at A+ quality.
> 2. **Plan ahead.** A 12-week calendar gives you breathing room and reduces stress.
> 3. **Use templates.** Trello created 5 blog post templates. Now writers spend less time on structure, more time on quality.

**Rating:** ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐

**Why it works:**
- Actionable (readers can apply these immediately)
- Specific (12-week calendar, 5 templates)
- Benefits-driven (reduces stress, improves quality)

---

### **What You Can Steal**

1. **Use a timeline breakdown** (Month 1, Month 2, etc.)
2. **Include a "Key Takeaways" section** at the end
3. **Mix quantitative (traffic) and qualitative (consistency) metrics**

---

### **What to Avoid**

- Don't skip the emotional/qualitative wins (Trello's "reduced stress" is huge)

---

## Case Study #3: Intercom + Product Hunt

**Company:** Intercom  
**Customer:** Product Hunt  
**URL:** intercom.com/customers/product-hunt  
**Overall Rating:** ⭐⭐⭐⭐ Great

---

### **The Hook**

> "Product Hunt reduced support tickets by 60% using Intercom's chatbot."

**Rating:** ⭐⭐⭐⭐

**Why it works:**
- One clear, impressive metric (60% reduction)
- Recognizable customer (Product Hunt)

**What could be better:**
- Missing the "before" context (how bad was it before?)

---

### **The Problem Section**

> "We were getting 500 support tickets a week, and 60% of them were the same 5 questions: How do I reset my password? How do I post a product? How do I upvote?"
>
> The support team was spending all their time answering repetitive questions instead of helping users with real issues.

**Rating:** ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐

**Why it works:**
- Specific numbers (500/week, 60%, 5 questions)
- Real examples (password reset, posting, upvoting)
- Shows impact on team (wasting time on repetitive questions)

---

### **The Solution Section**

> Product Hunt implemented Intercom's Answer Bot. They created automated responses for the top 20 FAQs. The bot answers instantly, escalates to a human if needed.
>
> "Setup took us about 4 hours. We wrote the FAQ answers, trained the bot, and went live."

**Rating:** ⭐⭐⭐⭐

**Why it works:**
- Specific implementation (Answer Bot, top 20 FAQs)
- Realistic timeline (4 hours setup)

**What could be better:**
- Missing "why they chose Intercom over competitors"

---

### **The Results Section**

> **Results:**
> - Support tickets: 500/week → 200/week (**60% reduction**)
> - Average response time: 4 hours → 30 seconds (**99% faster**)
> - Customer satisfaction: 7.2/10 → 9.1/10 (**+26%**)

**Rating:** ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐

**Why it works:**
- Clear before/after (500 → 200)
- Dramatic improvements (4 hours → 30 seconds)
- Multiple metrics (volume, speed, satisfaction)

---

### **What You Can Steal**

1. **Lead with one big metric in the headline** (60% reduction)
2. **Show real examples** (password reset, posting, upvoting)
3. **Include response time metrics** (if relevant to your product)

---

### **What to Avoid**

- Don't skip the "why us?" section

---

## Case Study #4: Zapier + Buffer

**Company:** Zapier  
**Customer:** Buffer  
**URL:** zapier.com/learn/customer-stories/buffer  
**Overall Rating:** ⭐⭐⭐⭐ Great

---

### **The Hook**

> "Buffer saves 40 hours per week by automating repetitive tasks with Zapier."

**Rating:** ⭐⭐⭐⭐

**Why it works:**
- Specific time savings (40 hours/week)
- Clear benefit (automation)

**What could be better:**
- Could add context (what does 40 hours/week mean for a team of X people?)

---

### **The Problem Section**

> Buffer's social media team was manually cross-posting content across 5 platforms. Every blog post required:
> - Manual posting to Twitter, Facebook, LinkedIn
> - Slack notification to the team
> - Adding the link to a Google Sheet for tracking
>
> "It was taking 30 minutes per post. We publish 8 posts a week, so that's 4 hours just on cross-posting."

**Rating:** ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐

**Why it works:**
- Specific workflow (cross-posting, Slack, Google Sheet)
- Math that proves the problem (30 min × 8 posts = 4 hours)
- Direct quote adds authenticity

---

### **The Solution Section**

> Buffer created 3 Zaps:
> 1. **New blog post → Auto-post to Twitter, Facebook, LinkedIn**
> 2. **New blog post → Send Slack notification to team**
> 3. **New blog post → Add row to Google Sheet**
>
> "We set it up in one afternoon. Now everything happens automatically."

**Rating:** ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐

**Why it works:**
- Specific Zaps (not vague "automations")
- Shows the workflow visually (list format)
- Realistic timeline (one afternoon)

---

### **The Results Section**

> | Task | Before (Manual) | After (Automated) | Time Saved |
> |------|----------------|-------------------|------------|
> | Cross-posting | 4 hours/week | 0 hours | **4 hours** |
> | Slack notifications | 1 hour/week | 0 hours | **1 hour** |
> | Spreadsheet updates | 1.5 hours/week | 0 hours | **1.5 hours** |
> | **Total** | **6.5 hours/week** | **0 hours** | **6.5 hours** |

**Rating:** ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐

**Why it works:**
- Breakdown by task (shows where time was wasted)
- Clear "before → after → savings" format
- Total at the bottom (6.5 hours/week = 26 hours/month)

---

### **What You Can Steal**

1. **Break down time savings by task** (not just one total number)
2. **Use math to prove the problem** (30 min × 8 = 4 hours)
3. **Show the actual automation workflow** (Zap #1, #2, #3)

---

### **What to Avoid**

- Don't just say "saved time" — show *where* the time was wasted

---

## Case Study #5: Notion + Figma

**Company:** Notion  
**Customer:** Figma  
**URL:** notion.so/customers/figma  
**Overall Rating:** ⭐⭐⭐ Good

---

### **The Hook**

> "Figma uses Notion as their single source of truth for product, design, and engineering."

**Rating:** ⭐⭐⭐

**Why it works:**
- Big-name customer (Figma)
- Clear use case (single source of truth)

**What could be better:**
- Missing a specific metric or result in the hook

---

### **The Problem Section**

> "We had information scattered across Google Docs, Confluence, Dropbox, and Slack. When someone asked 'where's the spec for Feature X?', no one knew."

**Rating:** ⭐⭐⭐⭐

**Why it works:**
- Relatable problem (information silos)
- Specific tools (Google Docs, Confluence, Dropbox, Slack)
- Real scenario (where's the spec?)

---

### **The Solution Section**

> Figma migrated all documentation to Notion. They created workspaces for:
> - Product specs
> - Design files
> - Engineering docs
> - Company wiki
>
> "Migration took about 2 weeks. The hardest part was getting people to change their habits."

**Rating:** ⭐⭐⭐

**Why it works:**
- Shows the structure (workspaces by function)
- Realistic timeline (2 weeks)

**What could be better:**
- Missing specific examples of what changed
- No quote from a Figma team member

---

### **The Results Section**

> **Results:**
> - Time spent searching for docs: 2 hours/week → 15 minutes/week
> - New hire onboarding: 4 weeks → 2 weeks
> - "Where's the doc?" Slack messages: 50/week → 5/week

**Rating:** ⭐⭐⭐⭐

**Why it works:**
- Multiple metrics (search time, onboarding, Slack messages)
- Creative metric ("Where's the doc?" messages)

**What could be better:**
- Could use a table format for scannability

---

### **What You Can Steal**

1. **Track "search time" or "time spent looking for things"** (great metric for productivity tools)
2. **Creative metrics** (Slack messages, support tickets, emails sent)
3. **Onboarding time** is a great metric if your product affects new hire ramp-up

---

### **What to Avoid**

- Don't skip the quotes (this case study felt less personal without them)

---

## Case Study #6: Airtable + BuzzFeed

**Company:** Airtable  
**Customer:** BuzzFeed  
**URL:** airtable.com/customers/buzzfeed  
**Overall Rating:** ⭐⭐⭐⭐ Great

---

### **The Hook**

> "BuzzFeed manages 200+ content projects per month using Airtable."

**Rating:** ⭐⭐⭐

**Why it works:**
- Impressive scale (200+ projects/month)

**What could be better:**
- Missing a transformation metric (what was it like before?)

---

### **The Problem Section**

> "We were using spreadsheets to track content. But with 200 projects happening at once, spreadsheets broke down. Formulas got messed up, version control was a nightmare, and we had no visibility into what was actually happening."

**Rating:** ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐

**Why it works:**
- Specific scale (200 projects)
- Relatable pain points (formulas, version control, visibility)
- Sets up the need for a better solution

---

### **The Solution Section**

> BuzzFeed built a custom content tracker in Airtable with:
> - **Status tracking:** Idea → In Progress → Review → Published
> - **Assignments:** Who's responsible for each piece
> - **Deadlines:** Automated reminders when deadlines approach
> - **Views:** Different views for writers, editors, and managers
>
> "We went from 'where are we on this?' to 'here's exactly where we are' in real-time."

**Rating:** ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐

**Why it works:**
- Shows the custom structure (status, assignments, deadlines, views)
- Quote captures the transformation (from chaos to clarity)

---

### **The Results Section**

> **Results:**
> - On-time delivery: 60% → 90%
> - "Where are we on this?" Slack messages: ~100/week → ~10/week
> - Time spent in status meetings: 3 hours/week → 30 minutes/week

**Rating:** ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐

**Why it works:**
- On-time delivery is a great metric for project management tools
- Creative metric (Slack messages)
- Meeting time savings (huge for managers)

---

### **What You Can Steal**

1. **Track "on-time delivery"** if your product affects project timelines
2. **Measure meeting time savings** (everyone hates meetings)
3. **Show how different roles use the product** (writers, editors, managers)

---

## Case Study #7: Typeform + Airbnb

**Customer:** Airbnb  
**URL:** typeform.com/customers/airbnb  
**Overall Rating:** ⭐⭐⭐ Good

> "Airbnb increased survey completion rates from 12% to 42% using Typeform."

**Rating:** ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐

**Why it works:**
- Dramatic improvement (12% → 42%)
- Clear metric (completion rate)

---

### **The Problem Section**

> "We were sending surveys via Google Forms. The completion rate was 12%. People would start the survey and drop off halfway through."

**Rating:** ⭐⭐⭐

**Why it works:**
- Specific tool (Google Forms)
- Clear problem (12% completion, drop-off)

**What could be better:**
- Missing *why* people were dropping off (too long? boring design?)

---

### **The Solution Section**

> Airbnb switched to Typeform. They:
> - Made surveys conversational (one question at a time)
> - Added progress bars (so people knew how long it would take)
> - Used logic jumps (skip irrelevant questions)

**Rating:** ⭐⭐⭐⭐

**Why it works:**
- Specific changes (one question at a time, progress bars, logic jumps)

**What could be better:**
- Missing a quote from an Airbnb team member

---

### **The Results Section**

> **Results:**
> - Completion rate: 12% → 42% (**+250%**)
> - Average time to complete: 8 minutes → 5 minutes
> - Responses per month: 1,200 → 4,200

**Rating:** ⭐⭐⭐⭐

**Why it works:**
- Clear before/after
- Multiple metrics (completion, time, volume)

---

### **What You Can Steal**

1. **Completion rate** is a great metric for forms, surveys, onboarding flows
2. **Show *how* you improved the experience** (one question at a time, progress bars)

---

**Company:** Asana  
**Customer:** Spotify

**Why it works:**
- Impressive scale (100+ projects)

---

### **The Problem Section**

**Why it works:**
- Specific pain point (coordination across 10 countries)
- Relatable frustration (hours in meetings)

---

### **The Solution Section**

**Rating:** ⭐⭐⭐⭐

**Why it works:**
- Multiple metrics (planning time, alignment, meeting time)

---

### **What You Can Steal**

1. **Meeting time savings** is always compelling
2. **Show cross-functional benefits** (not just one team)

---

## Case Study #9: Loom + GitLab

**Company:** Loom  
**Customer:** GitLab  
**URL:** loom.com/customers/gitlab  
**Overall Rating:** ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ Exceptional

---

### **The Hook**

> "GitLab's 1,300 remote employees send 10,000 Loom videos per month, saving 2,500 meetings."

**Rating:** ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐

**Why it works:**
- Impressive scale (1,300 employees, 10,000 videos)
- Shocking stat (2,500 meetings saved)

---

### **The Problem Section**

> "As an all-remote company, we were doing everything via Zoom. Design reviews, code walkthroughs, product demos — all required scheduling a meeting. Across 40 time zones, that's brutal."
>
> "I was spending 15 hours a week in meetings. It was unsustainable."

**Rating:** ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐

**Why it works:**
- Specific context (all-remote, 40 time zones)
- Personal quote (15 hours/week in meetings)
- Relatable pain (unsustainable)

---

### **The Solution Section**

> GitLab adopted Loom for async communication:
> - **Design reviews:** Designers record walkthroughs instead of scheduling meetings
> - **Code explanations:** Developers record explanations instead of writing long docs
> - **Product updates:** PMs record demos instead of doing live presentations
>

**Rating:** ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐

**Why it works:**
- Specific use cases (design, code, product)

---

### **The Results Section**

> - Loom videos sent: 10,000/month
> - Estimated meetings avoided: 2,500/month

**Rating:** ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐

- Multiple metrics (meetings, time, videos sent)
- "Meetings avoided" is a creative, compelling metric

---

### **What You Can Steal**

1. **"Meetings avoided" or "meetings reduced"** is a killer metric
2. **Show specific use cases by role** (designers, developers, PMs)
3. **Use a memorable quote** to capture the value prop

---

## Case Study #10: ConvertKit + Pat Flynn

**Company:** ConvertKit  
**Customer:** Pat Flynn (Smart Passive Income)

**Overall Rating:** ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ Exceptional

- Two impressive metrics (list growth + revenue increase)
- Recognizable customer (Pat Flynn is well-known in the creator economy)

---

### **The Problem Section**

> "I was using Mailchimp, and it was fine for basic newsletters. But I wanted to segment my audience, send targeted emails, and build automated funnels. Mailchimp couldn't do that without paying for expensive add-ons."
>
> "I was leaving money on the table because I couldn't send the right message to the right people."

**Rating:** ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐

**Why it works:**
- Direct quote (Pat's voice)
- Specific frustration (segmentation, targeting, automation)
- Stakes (leaving money on the table)

---

### **The Solution Section**

> Pat switched to ConvertKit and built:
> - **Segmented funnels:** Different welcome sequences for different audience segments
> - **Product launches:** Automated email sequences that sell products on autopilot
> - **Tags and triggers:** Tags based on behavior (clicked X link → send Y sequence)
>
> "ConvertKit gave me the tools to treat my email list like a real business, not just a broadcast channel."

**Rating:** ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐

**Why it works:**
- Shows specific features he used (segments, funnels, tags)
- Quote captures the transformation (broadcast → business)

---

### **The Results Section**

> **Results:**
> - Email list size: 80,000 → 200,000 (**+150%**)
> - Email-driven revenue: $50,000/year → $200,000/year (**+300%**)
> - Email open rate: 18% → 32%
> - Time spent managing email: 5 hours/week → 2 hours/week

**Rating:** ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐

**Why it works:**
- Revenue metric (everyone cares about money)
- Multiple supporting metrics (list size, open rate, time)
- Clear before/after

---

### **What You Can Steal**

1. **Revenue metrics** are the most powerful (if you can get them)
2. **Show both growth (list size) and efficiency (time saved)**
3. **Use customer quotes to frame the transformation** (broadcast → business)

---

## Summary: What the Best Case Studies Have in Common

### **1. Specific Metrics in the Hook**

**Bad:** "Customer X loves our product."  
**Good:** "Customer X reduced costs by 40% in 90 days."

---

### **2. Real Customer Quotes**

Every top case study uses direct quotes. Not paraphrases — their exact words.

---

### **3. Before/After Comparison**

**Table format works best:**

| Metric | Before | After | Change |
|--------|--------|-------|--------|

---

### **4. Multiple Metrics**

Don't just show one number. Show 3-5 metrics:
- Primary metric (the big win)
- Supporting metrics (other benefits)
- Unexpected metrics (creative measures like "meetings avoided")

---

### **5. Story Structure**

All great case studies follow: **Problem → Solution → Results**

---

### **6. Specific Implementation Details**

Don't just say "they used our product." Show *how*:
- What features they used
- What workflows they built
- How long it took to set up

---

### **7. Relatability**

The customer should represent your target audience. If you sell to SMBs, feature SMBs (not enterprises).
