# How to Record the Call-Content Demo Video

## Goal

Create a 60-90 second product demo video showing:
1. The problem (manual content creation takes hours)
2. The solution (upload transcript → get content in 10 min)
3. The result (blog post, case study, social posts)

**Use case:** Pricing page, Product Hunt launch, social media, email campaigns

---

## Tools You Need

### Screen Recording
- **Loom** (easiest, free) — https://loom.com
- **ScreenFlow** (Mac, $169) — More control, better editing
- **OBS Studio** (free, open source) — Full control

**Recommendation:** Use **Loom** for speed. You can record + edit in 30 minutes.

### Voiceover
- Built-in mic works fine
- If you have AirPods: Use those (better than laptop mic)
- Quiet room (close door, turn off fan/AC)

---

## Recording Checklist

**Before you hit record:**
- [ ] Close unnecessary tabs (only show Call-Content app)
- [ ] Clear browser notifications (turn on Do Not Disturb)
- [ ] Test audio (record 10 seconds, play it back)
- [ ] Zoom browser to 100% (not 125% or 90%)
- [ ] Clean up desktop/taskbar (hide personal stuff)

---

## Script (60-Second Version)

Use the script in `call-content-demo-video-script.md` (already written).

**TL;DR:**
1. **Hook (0-10 sec):** "Customer interviews take 3+ hours to turn into content. Here's how to do it in 10 minutes."
2. **Demo (10-50 sec):** Show upload → select templates → generate → export
3. **CTA (50-60 sec):** "Try it free for 14 days. Link in description."

---

## Step-by-Step Recording Process

### Step 1: Set Up Your Environment

1. Open Call-Content app (staging or localhost if not live yet)
2. Have a test transcript ready (use one of the 5 demo transcripts)
3. Clear any existing content (start from a clean state)
4. Open Loom or screen recorder

### Step 2: Record the Screen

**Loom settings:**
- Record: Screen + Camera (or Screen Only if you prefer)
- Resolution: 1080p
- Frame rate: 30 FPS

**What to show:**

1. **Problem Setup (5 sec):**
   - Show a wall of text (transcript)
   - Voiceover: "You just finished a customer interview. Now comes the hard part: turning this into content."

2. **Upload (10 sec):**
   - Drag and drop transcript file
   - Voiceover: "Upload your transcript..."
   - Show progress bar (if you have one)

3. **Select Templates (5 sec):**
   - Click checkboxes: Blog post, Case study, Social posts
   - Voiceover: "...choose what you want to create..."

4. **Generate (10 sec):**
   - Click "Generate Content"
   - Show loading spinner (if you have one)
   - Voiceover: "...and in 10 minutes, you get 12 ready-to-use assets."

5. **Results (20 sec):**
   - Show generated blog post (scroll quickly)
   - Show case study
   - Show LinkedIn posts (5 examples)
   - Voiceover: "Blog post, case study, social media posts, email sequences — all done."

6. **Export (5 sec):**
   - Click "Export to Google Docs" (or WordPress, Notion, etc.)
   - Voiceover: "Export to your CMS with one click."

7. **CTA (5 sec):**
   - Show pricing page or signup form
   - Voiceover: "Try it free for 14 days. No credit card required."

### Step 3: Record Voiceover

**Tips:**
- Speak slowly (faster = harder to understand)
- Pause between sentences (easier to edit)
- Smile while you talk (sounds friendlier)
- Re-record any stumbles (don't say "um" or "uh")

**Script timing:**
- Read the script aloud 2-3 times before recording
- Time yourself (should be 50-60 seconds)
- If too long, cut fluff ("basically," "essentially," etc.)

### Step 4: Edit the Video

**Loom editing:**
1. Trim beginning/end (cut dead air)
2. Remove mistakes (click "Cut" button)
3. Add captions (Loom auto-generates)
4. Add thumbnail (first frame or custom image)

**ScreenFlow editing (if using):**
1. Import screen recording
2. Sync voiceover (if recorded separately)
3. Add text overlays:
   - "Upload transcript"
   - "Select templates"
   - "Generate content"
   - "Export"
4. Add zoom-ins (highlight important UI elements)
5. Add background music (low volume, royalty-free)
6. Export as MP4 (1080p, 30 FPS)

## Common Mistakes (Avoid These)

### ❌ Mistake #1: Talking Too Fast
**Why it fails:** Viewers can't follow  
**Fix:** Slow down. Pause between sentences.

### ❌ Mistake #2: Showing Too Much
**Why it fails:** Overwhelming  
**Fix:** Show one feature flow (upload → generate → export). That's it.

### ❌ Mistake #3: No Captions
**Why it fails:** 80% watch without sound  
**Fix:** Always add captions (auto-generate is fine)

### ❌ Mistake #4: Low Audio Quality
**Why it fails:** Hard to hear = people bounce  
**Fix:** Use AirPods or USB mic. Record in quiet room.

### ❌ Mistake #5: Too Long
**Why it fails:** Attention span is 60 seconds  
**Fix:** Keep it under 90 seconds. Cut ruthlessly.
