---

## Pre-Launch Checklist (14 Days Before)

### **Day -14: Set the Date**

**Best days to launch:**
- **Tuesday-Thursday** (highest traffic)
- Avoid: Mondays (people catching up), Fridays (weekend mindset), holidays

**Time:**
- Product Hunt resets at **12:01 AM PST**
- Be ready to post at exactly 12:01 AM (set an alarm!)

**Action:**
- [ ] Pick date (Tuesday-Thursday in Week 4)
- [ ] Block calendar (you'll be responding to comments all day)

---

### **Day -13 to -10: Build Your Supporter Army**

You need **10-15 people ready to upvote + comment** in the first hour.

**Who to recruit:**
1. Friends/family (even non-tech people can upvote)
2. Existing customers (send personal DMs)
3. Twitter followers (ask in DMs, not public tweet)
4. Indie maker communities (r/SaaS, Indie Hackers)
5. Past colleagues

**How to ask:**

> Hey [Name]! I'm launching Call-Content on Product Hunt on [Date] and would love your support. Would you be willing to:
> 
> 1. Upvote at 12:01 AM PST (I'll send a reminder link)
> 2. Leave a comment (even just "congrats!" helps)
> 
> No pressure if you're busy, but I'd really appreciate it!

**Action:**
- [ ] Create a list of 20-30 people
- [ ] Send personal DMs (not mass email — feels spammy)
- [ ] Track confirmations in a spreadsheet

---

### **Day -9 to -7: Find a Hunter (Optional)**

**What's a Hunter?**  
Someone with Product Hunt credibility who "hunts" your product (posts it for you).

**Do you need one?**  
Not anymore — Product Hunt removed hunter boost in 2023. You can post yourself.

**If you want one anyway:**
- Look for makers with 1,000+ followers on PH
- Check their past hunts (did products do well?)
- Reach out: "Hey, I'm launching [Product]. Would you be interested in hunting it?"

**Action:**
- [ ] Decide: Hunter or self-post?
- [ ] If hunter: Reach out by Day -7

### **12:01-1:00 AM: First Hour Blitz**

**This is the most important hour.**  
Product Hunt's algorithm heavily weights early engagement.

**Your job:**
1. Respond to every comment within 5 minutes
2. Upvote other products (karma helps)
3. Thank supporters publicly

**Comment response template:**

> Thanks [Name]! [Answer their question + ask a follow-up]
>
> What's your current workflow for [related task]?

**Don't just say "Thanks!" — engage.**

---

### **6:00 AM: Social Media Push**

**Twitter Thread:**

> 🚀 We just launched Call-Content on @ProductHunt!
>
> After spending 20+ hours/month turning customer calls into content, I built a tool to automate 90% of it.
>
> Here's how it works 🧵
>
> [Thread continues with screenshots, demo, CTA]
>
> Link: [Product Hunt URL]
>
> If you've ever spent hours writing case studies from scratch, this will save you 10-15 hours/month. Would mean the world if you checked it out!

**LinkedIn Post:**

> I just launched Call-Content on Product Hunt.
>
> Here's the problem I was solving:
>
> Every month, I'd conduct 10-15 customer interviews. Each one had incredible insights — perfect for blog posts, case studies, and social media.
>
> But turning those 30-minute calls into polished content took 3-4 hours per call. I was spending 40+ hours/month on content creation.
>
> So I built Call-Content to automate it.
>
> Upload a transcript → Get a blog post, case study, 5 LinkedIn posts, 10 tweets, and an email sequence in 10 minutes.
>
> It's not perfect (you still need to edit), but it saves 90% of the grunt work.
>
> If you've ever struggled with content creation from customer calls, check it out: [Product Hunt link]
>
> We're live on Product Hunt today, and I'd love your feedback!

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

### ❌ **Mistake #1: Launching on a Monday or Friday**
**Why it fails:** Low traffic, less visibility  
**Fix:** Launch Tuesday-Thursday

---

### ❌ **Mistake #2: Not Preparing Supporters**
**Why it fails:** No early momentum = algorithm buries you  
**Fix:** Line up 10-15 people to upvote in first hour

---

### ❌ **Mistake #3: Writing a Generic First Comment**
**Why it fails:** Doesn't hook readers, no social proof  
**Fix:** Tell a story (problem → solution → how it works)

---

### ❌ **Mistake #4: Ignoring Comments**
**Why it fails:** Looks like you don't care, reduces engagement  
**Fix:** Respond to every comment within 1-2 hours

---

### ❌ **Mistake #5: Not Offering a Special Deal**
**Why it fails:** No urgency to sign up  
**Fix:** "30% off for Product Hunt users" or "Lifetime deal for first 100"

---
