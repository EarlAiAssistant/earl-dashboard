## Production Notes

### Visual Style:
- **Clean, minimal UI** (not cluttered)
- **Fast pacing** (cut dead air, keep it moving)
- **Use real product** (not mockups—show actual Call-Content interface)
- **Annotations** (highlight key buttons, features with arrows/circles)

### Voiceover:
- **Tone:** Conversational, helpful (not salesy)
- **Pacing:** 120-140 words/minute (slightly faster than normal speech = energetic)
- **Voice:** Professional but friendly (think: explaining to a colleague, not pitching a stranger)

### Music:
- **Background track:** Upbeat, modern (not cheesy corporate music)
- **Volume:** Low (30% max—voiceover is priority)
- **Suggestion:** "Inspiring Corporate" or "Tech Product" tracks from Epidemic Sound

### Screen Recording Tips:
1. **Use 1920x1080 resolution** (scales well for YouTube, social)
2. **Hide desktop clutter** (close unnecessary tabs, clean desktop)
3. **Use smooth scrolling** (no jerky mouse movements)
4. **Highlight cursor** (make it larger/more visible in recording)
5. **Zoom in on key actions** (upload button, generate button)
