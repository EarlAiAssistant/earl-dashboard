Hi [First Name],

Hope you're doing well! I noticed you've been using [Product] for [X months/weeks] and wanted to reach out.

I'm always looking to improve the product, and your perspective would be incredibly valuable. Would you be open to a quick 15-20 minute call to share your experience?

I'd love to hear:

• How you're using it day-to-day

• Any features you wish we had

If you're up for it, here's my calendar: [Calendly link]

No pressure if you're too busy—I know your time is valuable!

Hi [First Name],

I'm [Your Name], founder of [Product]. I came across your [blog/LinkedIn/company] and noticed you're doing a lot of [customer interviews / user research / content marketing].

I'm working on improving [Product] (we help [specific people] turn customer calls into marketing content), and I'd love to learn from how you approach [customer interviews / content creation].

Would you be open to a quick 20-minute call? I'd love to hear:
• How you currently handle customer interviews
• What tools you're using (if any)
• What's frustrating about the process

This isn't a sales call—I'm genuinely looking for feedback from people who do this regularly. And if the conversation sparks any ideas for how [Product] could help you, I'm happy to set you up with a free account.

Here's my calendar if you're interested: [Calendly link]

```
Hi [First Name],

I saw your [review / message / feedback] about [Product] and it totally made my day! 🙌

You said: "[Quote their exact words]"

Would you be comfortable with me using this as a testimonial on our website? I think it'd really help other [consultants / coaches / founders] understand how [Product] can help them.

If yes, I just need:
• Your approval to use the quote
• Your preferred attribution (e.g., "Sarah M., Marketing Consultant" or just "Sarah M.")
• (Optional) A headshot if you're comfortable with it

And if you'd be willing to expand on it a bit (2-3 sentences about the specific results you've seen), that would be even better—but no pressure!

Either way, thank you for being an awesome customer. It means a lot.

Best,
[Your Name]

P.S. As a thanks, I'm upgrading your account to [next tier] for the next 3 months. Enjoy!
```

**What Makes This Work:**
- Starts with their actual words (shows you're listening)

### Email Body:

Hi [First Name],

Thanks again for the call last week! I loved hearing about how you [specific result, e.g., "turned 20 customer interviews into case studies in a month"].

Your story is exactly what other [consultants / coaches / SaaS founders] need to hear. Would you be open to me featuring it as a case study on our website?

Here's what that would look like:
• I'd write a 500-800 word case study (you'd approve it before we publish)
• We'd highlight the problem you had, how you used [Product], and the results
• We'd include a quote or two from our call
• We'd link to your [website / LinkedIn / company] (free exposure for you!)

**Your specific results:**
• [Metric 1: e.g., "Saved 3+ hours per customer interview"]
• [Metric 2: e.g., "Published 12 case studies in first month"]
• [Metric 3: e.g., "Booked 5 new clients from LinkedIn posts"]

If you're up for it, I'll send you the draft by [date] for your review. You can edit, request changes, or veto it entirely—you have full control.

Sound good?

Let me know if you have any questions!

Best,
[Your Name]

You've been using [Product] for [X months] now, and I'm so glad it's been helpful! 🎉

Quick question: Do you know 1-2 other [consultants / coaches / founders] who might benefit from turning their customer calls into content?

If so, I'd love to offer them a free trial + a personalized onboarding call (something I don't usually do, but I'm doing it for your referrals).

**What's in it for you?**
• $50 account credit for each referral who starts a trial
• $200 account credit if they become a paying customer
• My eternal gratitude 🙏

You can just reply with their name/email, or forward this email to them with a quick intro. Either works!

Thanks for being an awesome customer.

Hi [First Name],

I noticed you haven't logged into [Product] in a few weeks, and I wanted to check in.

Did you hit a roadblock? Is something not working the way you expected? Or did life just get busy? (Totally get it if so!)

If it's a product issue, I'd love to help fix it. Some common things people get stuck on:
• Uploading transcripts (we support text files, audio, and video now)
• Customizing brand voice (there's a new settings panel)
• Exporting content (you can now export to Google Docs, Notion, etc.)

If it's a "life got busy" thing, no worries—your account is still active whenever you're ready to use it.

But if [Product] isn't meeting your needs, I'd genuinely love to know why. Even if you decide to cancel, your feedback would help me make it better for the next person.

Want to jump on a quick 10-minute call? Here's my calendar: [Calendly link]

Or just reply to this email if you'd rather share feedback in writing.

Either way, thanks for giving [Product] a shot!

Best,
[Your Name]

P.S. If you come back in the next 7 days, I'll extend your trial by 2 weeks. No credit card required.
```

**What Makes This Work:**
- Non-judgmental tone ("did life get busy?")
- Offers help (specific examples of common issues)
- Asks for feedback (even if they cancel)
- Incentive to return (2-week extension)
- Personal touch (offer to jump on a call)

## Email 6: Win-Back (Churned Customer)

### Subject Line Options:
- "We miss you! (And we've improved)"
- "Come back? Here's what's new."
- "50% off to give us another shot"
- "[First Name], what would it take to win you back?"

### Email Body:

```
Hi [First Name],

I noticed you canceled your [Product] subscription a few weeks ago, and I wanted to reach out.

First off: no hard feelings. I know the product isn't for everyone, and that's okay.

But I'm curious—what made you decide to cancel? Was it:
• Price? (too expensive for the value)
• Features? (missing something you needed)
• Workflow? (too complicated or time-consuming)
• Results? (didn't save you as much time as expected)
• Something else?

I'm asking because we've made some big improvements since you left:
• [New feature 1: e.g., "Audio/video upload (no need to transcribe first)"]
• [New feature 2: e.g., "Custom templates (create your own output formats)"]
• [New feature 3: e.g., "Notion/Google Docs integration"]

If any of these sound interesting, I'd love to offer you **50% off for the next 3 months** to give us another shot.

No pressure—I just wanted you to know we're listening and improving.

Reply to this email if you'd like the discount code, or if you just want to share feedback (even if you're not coming back).

Thanks for giving [Product] a chance!

Best,
[Your Name]

P.S. If price was the issue, we now have a $27/month Starter tier (was $47 before). Might be a better fit?
```

**What Makes This Work:**
- Non-defensive tone ("no hard feelings")
- Asks why they left (genuine curiosity)
- Highlights improvements (shows you're listening)
- Strong incentive (50% off for 3 months)
- Offers feedback option (even if they don't return)

- "Time to upgrade? You've maxed out [tier]"
- "You've used 20/20 transcripts this month 🔥"
- "Looks like you need more transcripts!"

### Email Body:

```
Hi [First Name],

Great news: You've processed all 20 transcripts in your Starter plan this month! 🎉

That means you've created **240 marketing assets** (20 transcripts × 12 assets each). That's incredible.

**Here's the thing:**
You're clearly getting value from [Product], but you're hitting your limit. You have two options:

**Option 1: Upgrade to Professional ($47/month)**
• 50 transcripts/month (instead of 20)
• Everything in Starter, plus:
  - Priority support
  - Custom templates
  - Team collaboration features

**Option 2: Buy a Booster Pack (+10 transcripts for $27)**
• One-time purchase
• Use them anytime this month
• Good if you just need a few extra

Which sounds better?

Upgrade here: [link]
Or reply to this email if you have questions!

Best,
[Your Name]

P.S. If you upgrade before [date], I'll throw in an extra 10 transcripts for free. Just reply and I'll apply it to your account.
```

**What Makes This Work:**
- Frames limit as success ("you're crushing it")
- Quantifies value (240 assets created)
- Presents clear options (upgrade vs. booster pack)
- Limited-time incentive (10 free transcripts)
- Easy action (click link or reply)
