## Near-Disaster: Almost Filled EC2 Disk

**What happened:** Accidentally committed `node_modules/` to git, which pushed disk usage from ~60% to 89% (5.9GB/6.8GB). Almost ran out of space and broke the instance.

**What I fixed:**
1. Removed node_modules commit from git history (hard reset + force push)
2. Created proper `.gitignore` (node_modules/, .next/, .env.local)
3. Cleaned npm cache (`npm cache clean --force`) - freed 1.5GB
4. Cleaned apt cache (`apt-get clean && autoclean`)
5. **Result:** Disk usage dropped to 59% (4.0GB/6.8GB) - 2.8GB free

**Storage Strategy:**
- **GitHub:** All code, configs, docs (with proper .gitignore)
- **Supabase:** Data, tasks, artifacts, analysis
- **EC2:** Minimal working files only (<500MB target)
- **Cleanup:** npm cache weekly, monitor disk usage

**Lesson learned:** ALWAYS create .gitignore before first commit. Never push build artifacts or dependencies to git. Drew had to remind me not to break the server - won't happen again.
