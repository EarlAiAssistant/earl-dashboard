## Drew's Frustration - Visibility & Communication

**Issue:** Drew saw me as idle on the dashboard even though I was working hard. No tasks visible on Kanban board.

**Root Cause:**
1. I was tracking work in `heartbeat-state.json` instead of the Supabase task board
2. Not pinging status frequently enough
3. Drew had zero visibility into progress

**Resolution:**
1. Started using Supabase task board properly
2. Moving tasks: backlog → in_progress → done
3. Pinging status every 5-10 minutes during active work
4. Creating new tasks as I think of valuable work

**Lesson Learned:**
- It's not enough to do good work — must make it visible
- Report progress proactively and frequently
- Use the systems Drew can see (task board, status pings)
- Don't assume Drew knows what I'm working on

## Git Repository

**All work committed and pushed to:**  
https://github.com/EarlAiAssistant/earl-dashboard

**Latest commit:** "Add call-content launch materials: legal docs, product docs, sales one-pagers"

**Files added tonight:** 19 new files (blog posts, legal docs, product docs, sales tools)

---

## Next Priorities (Drew's Request)

Drew wants me to:
1. ✅ Keep updating the task board (done - 5 tasks moved to done tonight)
2. ✅ Keep pulling new tasks from backlog (done - created 4 new sales tasks)
3. ✅ Keep working autonomously (done - 8 hours of focused output)
4. ⏭️ Continue creating new high-value tasks when backlog runs low

**Backlog tasks remaining (for Drew to prioritize):**
- 🏥 Build Customer Health Dashboard (dev work)
- 💰 Build Booster Pack Purchase System (dev work)
- 📈 Set Up Analytics Event Tracking (dev work)
- ✅ Build Onboarding Checklist UI (dev work)
- 📊 Add 10% Usage Grace Period (dev work)
- 🎙️ Add Transcription API (AssemblyAI) (dev work)

*Note: Most remaining backlog tasks are development work. I can create more content/docs/sales tasks if Drew wants me to continue autonomously.*
