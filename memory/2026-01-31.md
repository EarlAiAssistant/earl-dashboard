## Tile Table Building Instructions

Drew is building a DIY tile table with plywood base, ceramic tiles, and wood trim.

**Project details:**
- Table size: 36 7/16" × 18 1/4"
- Tiles: 6" × 6" ceramic, laid 6×3 pattern
- Grout lines: 1/16" (math worked out perfectly!)
- Wood trim around perimeter

**Created comprehensive 3-page instruction guide:**
- Materials list with specific product recommendations
- Step-by-step process (stain/attach trim, tile, grout, seal)
- Product recommendations:
  - Nails: 16-gauge steel finish nails, 2" ($3-5)
  - Stain: 8 oz Minwax or Varathane ($5-8)
  - Poly: Water-based satin/semi-gloss, Minwax Polycrylic ($12-18)
  - Grout sealer: Aqua Mix Sealer's Choice Gold or Miracle 511 ($12-20)
- Timeline: 2 weeks total, 8-10 hours hands-on
- Pro tips and troubleshooting

**File:** `tile-table-instructions.md` (4.7K, 131 lines) - saved to GitHub

## Land Savings Roadmap

Drew wants to save for 40 acres of land in Upper Peninsula Michigan.

**Goal:** Purchase raw/improved land for future homestead/cabin
- Estimated cost: $120k-150k ($3k-4k per acre typical)
- Down payment needed: 30-40% for land loan = **$40k-57k target**
- Land loans require higher down payment than house mortgages (riskier for banks)

**Completed:** `land-savings-roadmap.md` (9KB comprehensive financial plan)

**Contents:**
- Financial requirements breakdown (down payment analysis)
- Savings strategy (4-step process)
- Timeline scenarios (Conservative, Moderate, Aggressive)
- Milestones with dollar targets ($10k, $25k, $45k)
- Loan pre-approval timeline
- Property research checklist
- Monthly tracker template
- Risk mitigation strategies
- 30-day action plan
- Resources (land search sites, financing options, UP-specific info)

**Key Insights:**
- 35% down payment target = $45,000 (sweet spot for rates + timeline)
- Conservative timeline: 30 months ($1,500/month)
- Aggressive timeline: 13 months ($3,500/month with side income)
- Side income adds $500/month = shaves 1 year off timeline

## Earl Self-Reporting Heartbeat API

Drew asked for simpler status monitoring. Built custom API instead of complex multi-source checking.

**Created:**
- `/api/earl/heartbeat` endpoint (GET/POST)
- File-based status storage (`.earl-status.json`)
- Simplified EarlStatus component (polls every 15s)
- Helper script: `earl-helpers/ping-status.sh`
- Updated HEARTBEAT.md to ping on every heartbeat

**How it works:**
1. I ping API when I do work
2. Dashboard polls every 15 seconds
3. Auto-marks idle (5 min) / offline (60 min)
4. Shows task, model, session uptime

**Status:** Deployed to Vercel

## Repo Consolidation

Drew wanted ONE repo instead of two (earl-dashboard-kanban was confusing).

**Actions:**
- Merged all workspace files into earl-dashboard repo
- Removed earl-dashboard-kanban from workspace
- Single source of truth: https://github.com/EarlAiAssistant/earl-dashboard
- All work files + dashboard code in one place

## Drew's Frustration - Visibility Issue

**Problem:** Drew saw dashboard showing me idle and no tasks in Kanban board, even though I was working hard.

**Root cause:**
1. I was working through heartbeat-state.json instead of a visible Kanban board
2. I wasn't pinging status frequently enough (every 5-10 min)
3. No visible progress updates for Drew to see

**Resolution:**
1. Committed to pinging status more frequently during work
2. Updated heartbeat-state.json with all completed work
3. Will be more proactive about making work visible in future

**Lesson learned:** It's not enough to do good work — I need to make it visible and report progress regularly.
