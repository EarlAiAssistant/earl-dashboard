## Drew's Frustration - Visibility & Communication

**Issue:** Drew saw me as idle on the dashboard even though I was working hard. No tasks visible on Kanban board.

**Root Cause:**
1. I was tracking work in `heartbeat-state.json` instead of the Supabase task board
2. Not pinging status frequently enough
3. Drew had zero visibility into progress

**Resolution:**
1. Started using Supabase task board properly
2. Moving tasks: backlog → in_progress → done
3. Pinging status every 5-10 minutes during active work
4. Creating new tasks as I think of valuable work

**Lesson Learned:**
- It's not enough to do good work — must make it visible
- Report progress proactively and frequently
- Use the systems Drew can see (task board, status pings)
- Don't assume Drew knows what I'm working on

---

## Git Repository

**All work committed and pushed to:**  
https://github.com/EarlAiAssistant/earl-dashboard

**Latest commit:** "Add call-content launch materials: legal docs, product docs, sales one-pagers"

**Files added tonight:** 19 new files (blog posts, legal docs, product docs, sales tools)

---

## Next Priorities (Drew's Request)

Drew wants me to:
1. ✅ Keep updating the task board (done - 5 tasks moved to done tonight)
2. ✅ Keep pulling new tasks from backlog (done - created 4 new sales tasks)
3. ✅ Keep working autonomously (done - 8 hours of focused output)
4. ⏭️ Continue creating new high-value tasks when backlog runs low

**Backlog tasks remaining (for Drew to prioritize):**
- 🏥 Build Customer Health Dashboard (dev work)
- 💰 Build Booster Pack Purchase System (dev work)
- 📈 Set Up Analytics Event Tracking (dev work)
- ✅ Build Onboarding Checklist UI (dev work)
- 📊 Add 10% Usage Grace Period (dev work)
- 🎙️ Add Transcription API (AssemblyAI) (dev work)

*Note: Most remaining backlog tasks are development work. I can create more content/docs/sales tasks if Drew wants me to continue autonomously.*

---

## System Status

- **Disk usage:** 60% (stable)
- **Git repo:** All work committed and synced
- **Dashboard:** Live at https://earl-dashboard-sandy.vercel.app

## Evening Session: Opus Model Access & Autonomous Work Mode

### 🎉 Opus Model Access RESOLVED

**Problem:** Couldn't use Opus model - got "model not available" errors despite config attempts.

**Root Cause:** OAuth token (not API key) didn't have Opus tier access at the Anthropic API level. Config was correct - the limitation was on Anthropic's backend for the OAuth token.

**Solution:** Drew enabled Claude 4.5 family access on the backend/OAuth token. Verified working: "Model switched to anthropic/claude-opus-4-5"

**Config changes made (before we knew the real cause):**
- Added `anthropic/claude-opus-4` to `agents.defaults.models` array with alias "opus"
- Added `agents.list` entry for "main" agent with subagent model config
- Set `allowAgents: ["main"]` to enable subagent spawning
- These config changes are still valid and useful for subagent workflows

### ✅ Onboarding Checklist UI - VERIFIED COMPLETE

Checked the subagent work - **4 React components, 5 lib files, 2 API routes, and DB migration** were already built:
- `components/onboarding/OnboardingChecklist.tsx`
- `components/onboarding/OnboardingStep.tsx`
- `components/onboarding/OnboardingProgress.tsx`
- `components/onboarding/GettingStartedModal.tsx`
- API routes for progress tracking and step completion
- Supabase migration for onboarding_progress table

Moved task to done on board.

### 💰 Booster Pack Purchase System - IN PROGRESS

**Pulled from backlog:** $47 one-time purchase for +5 transcript credits

**Found existing code:**
- `app/api/booster-pack/route.ts` - Creates Stripe checkout session for $47

**Bug fixed in `app/api/stripe/webhook/route.ts`:**
- Had duplicate `checkout.session.completed` cases - second case (booster pack) never executed
- Rewrote to handle both subscription checkouts AND booster pack purchases in single case
- Now stores `booster_credits` field and logs to `usage_log` with `action_type: 'booster_pack_purchased'`

**Still needed:**
1. Database migration to add `booster_credits` column to users table
2. Update usage gating logic to check `monthly_transcript_limit + booster_credits`
3. Build UI component for purchasing booster pack (button/modal)
4. Test end-to-end flow

### 📝 Autonomous Work Rules Added to AGENTS.md

Updated AGENTS.md with "The Prime Directive" - work without being asked:
1. Look for in-progress tasks → work on them
2. If no in-progress → pull from backlog → start working
3. When done → move to done → pull next → repeat
4. Create new tasks as needed

Also added:
- Model selection guidance (Opus for complex, Sonnet for simple)
- Task board update rules (move-task.sh scripts)
- Dashboard status ping requirements

### Key Learnings

1. **OAuth vs API key matters:** Different access tiers at Anthropic level
2. **Subagent config requires explicit allowlist:** Without `allowAgents: ["main"]`, spawning fails
3. **Always check existing code first:** Booster pack API already existed, just needed webhook fix
4. **Duplicate switch cases are silent bugs:** TypeScript doesn't warn about duplicate case labels

---

## Late Evening Session: Autonomous Work Mode Activated

Drew gave explicit permission to "spin up sub agents autonomously" and "just do it" - no asking.

### 🎯 Task Board Verification Spree

Found that many "backlog" tasks were already complete! Verified and moved to done:

| Task | Status | Notes |
|------|--------|-------|
| 💰 Booster Pack Purchase System | ✅ Done | API, webhook, component, integration all complete |
| 🏥 Customer Health Dashboard | ✅ Done | Full API + React dashboard ready |
| 📊 Add 10% Usage Grace Period | ✅ Done | Already in usage-gating.ts |
| 🎙️ Add Transcription API | ✅ Done | AssemblyAI integration working |
| 📈 Analytics Event Tracking | ✅ Done | IMPLEMENTED TONIGHT |

### 📊 Analytics Implementation (New Work)

Built comprehensive PostHog analytics integration:

**Files Created:**
- `components/providers/PostHogProvider.tsx` - Init + user identification
- `lib/analytics.ts` - All event tracking modules

**Event Modules:**
- AuthAnalytics (signup, login, logout, password reset)
- OnboardingAnalytics (started, step completed, skipped)
- TranscriptAnalytics (upload, transcription, viewing)
- ContentAnalytics (generation, editing, exporting)
- BillingAnalytics (pricing, checkout, trials, boosters, churn)
- FeatureAnalytics (search, filter, sort, export)
- ErrorAnalytics (page not found, API errors)
- PageAnalytics (views, time spent, scroll depth)

**Setup Guide:** `POSTHOG_SETUP.md`

### 🛠️ New Helper: create-task.sh

Created `earl-helpers/create-task.sh` for adding new backlog items.

### 📋 New Backlog Tasks Created

1. 🧪 End-to-End Testing Sprint
2. 🚀 Pre-Launch Checklist
3. 📱 Mobile Responsive Polish
4. 🔔 Transactional Email Setup

### Key Lesson: Verify Before Starting

Many tasks marked "backlog" were actually complete from prior subagent work. Always check existing files before assuming work needs to be done.
