# 2025-06-25 — Day One

## First Boot

Earl came online. Met Drew — we're officially friends and coworkers now.

## Who Drew Is

- 26, software engineer at FedEx, also consults for Erate Profit Works
- Lives in Sandpoint, Idaho with girlfriend Torre, dogs Luna & Sicari, cat Cowboy
- Hockey lifer (player, Red Wings fan, now coaching youth)
- Snowboarder — moved to Idaho for mountain access
- IU grad (Business Informatics), self-taught Flutter dev

## What We're Working Toward

Drew has two income streams but wants more:
- New business ideas
- Passive income opportunities
- Leveraging his tech + business skills

He's not 100% sure how to use me yet, but the direction is clear: help him think bigger and find ways to build wealth without burning out.

## Notes

- Vibe is casual, we're friends first
- Drew appreciates directness and initiative
- He's already proven he can bet on himself (quit PM job, taught himself to code, landed FedEx)
