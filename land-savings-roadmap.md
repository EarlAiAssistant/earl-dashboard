# Land Savings Roadmap
## 40 Acres in Michigan's Upper Peninsula

**Goal:** Purchase raw/improved land for future homestead/cabin  
**Target Location:** Upper Peninsula, Michigan  
**Estimated Cost:** $120,000 - $150,000 ($3,000-$4,000/acre typical)

---

## Financial Requirements

### Down Payment (Critical)
Land loans require **30-40% down payment** (banks view raw land as higher risk than developed property).

- **Minimum down payment:** $36,000 (30% of $120k)
- **Recommended target:** $45,000-$57,000 (35-40%)
- **Why more is better:** Lower monthly payment, better interest rate, stronger negotiating position

### Total Purchase Breakdown (Example: $135k property)
```
Purchase Price:        $135,000
Down Payment (35%):     $47,250
Loan Amount:            $87,750
Estimated Rate:         7-9% APR (land loans higher than mortgages)
Term:                   15-20 years
Monthly Payment:        ~$750-850
```

## Savings Strategy

### Step 1: Establish Baseline (Month 1)
**Action Items:**
- [ ] Calculate current liquid savings
- [ ] Review FedEx salary + Erate consulting income
- [ ] Track expenses for 30 days (get real numbers)
- [ ] Identify recurring expenses that can be reduced
- [ ] Set monthly savings target (recommend 20-30% of net income)

### Step 2: Open Dedicated Savings Account (Month 1)
**Recommended: Fidelity Cash Management Account**
- 4-5% APY (current market rates)
- FDIC insured up to $1.25M
- Integrates with existing Fidelity 401k dashboard
- No fees, free debit card, ATM fee reimbursement
- Easy transfers to brokerage if you want to invest a portion

**Why not just checking?**
- Typical checking: 0.01% APY → earn $5/year on $50k
- High-yield savings: 4.5% APY → earn $2,250/year on $50k
- **That's $2,245 more** working for you while you save

### Step 3: Automate Contributions (Month 2)
Set up automatic transfers on payday:
- FedEx paycheck → X% to land fund
- Erate payments → Y% to land fund
- Remainder → checking for living expenses

**Example Split (adjust based on your numbers):**
```
Monthly Income:           $8,000 (hypothetical)
Living Expenses:          $5,000
Land Fund Auto-Transfer:  $2,000 (25%)
Emergency Buffer:         $1,000
```

### Step 4: Accelerate with Side Income (Ongoing)
Focus on high-ROI opportunities from `drew-income-acceleration-ideas.md`:

**Quick wins (Month 1-3):**
- Freelance Flutter consulting ($100-150/hr)
- Expand Erate consulting (add 1-2 clients)
- SaaS micro-product launch (call-content, etc.)

**All side income → 100% to land fund**  
Example: $500/month side income = $6,000/year extra = 1 year faster to goal

---

## Timeline Scenarios

### Conservative (No Side Income)
```
Monthly savings:  $1,500
Target amount:    $45,000
Timeline:         30 months (2.5 years)
With 4.5% APY:    ~$47,700 total (interest adds $2,700)
```

### Moderate (Some Side Income)
```
Monthly savings:  $2,000 base + $500 side income = $2,500/month
Target amount:    $45,000
Timeline:         18 months (1.5 years)
With 4.5% APY:    ~$46,300 total (interest adds $1,300)
```

### Aggressive (Strong Side Income)
```
Monthly savings:  $2,000 base + $1,500 side income = $3,500/month
Target amount:    $45,000
Timeline:         13 months (just over 1 year)
With 4.5% APY:    ~$45,800 total (interest adds $800)
```

## Property Research Checklist

While saving, research properties to know exactly what you want:

**Must-Haves:**
- [ ] Road access (private road, public road, or seasonal access?)
- [ ] Buildable land (zoning allows residential structures?)
- [ ] Water source (well potential, nearby lake/river?)
- [ ] Power options (grid hookup vs. solar/generator?)
- [ ] Property taxes (annual cost?)
- [ ] Survey availability (boundary lines clear?)

**Nice-to-Haves:**
- [ ] Wooded vs. open land ratio
- [ ] Topography (flat, rolling hills, waterfront?)
- [ ] Wildlife/hunting potential
- [ ] Proximity to town (30 min? 1 hour?)
- [ ] Neighbors (how close?)

## Monthly Tracker Template

Create a simple spreadsheet or note to track progress:

```
Month     | Base Savings | Side Income | Interest | Total      | Goal Progress
----------|--------------|-------------|----------|------------|---------------
Feb 2026  | $2,000       | $300        | $8       | $2,308     | $2,308 / $45,000 (5%)
Mar 2026  | $2,000       | $600        | $17      | $2,617     | $4,925 / $45,000 (11%)
Apr 2026  | $2,000       | $800        | $26      | $2,826     | $7,751 / $45,000 (17%)
...
```

**Visual Progress:**
- Create a simple chart/graph
- Update monthly
- Watch the line go up and to the right 📈

## Risk Mitigation

### Keep 6-Month Emergency Fund Separate
- Don't raid the land fund for emergencies
- Maintain $10k-15k buffer in separate savings
- Land is a goal, not a necessity—protect your financial stability first

### Don't Pause 401k Contributions
- Keep getting FedEx match (free money)
- Land fund is *in addition to* retirement, not instead of
- Future you will thank present you

### Market Timing
- Land prices don't swing wildly like stocks
- When you hit your target, start shopping—don't try to time the market
- Good deals appear randomly; be ready to move when they do

## Resources

### Land Search Sites:
- **LandWatch.com** - Best for filtering by acreage, price, features
- **Zillow** - Good for listings, but less land-specific filters
- **Land and Farm** - Focuses on rural/agricultural properties
- **Craigslist** - Occasional gems, owner-financed deals
- **Local realtors** - Many UP listings don't hit national sites

### Financing Options:
- **Local credit unions** - Often best rates for land loans (check UP-based CUs)
- **Farm Credit Services** - Specializes in rural/ag land
- **Traditional banks** - Higher rates, but more options
- **Owner financing** - Negotiate directly with seller (often better terms)

### Michigan UP Resources:
- **UP Land Conservancy** - Info on land preservation, access rights
- **Michigan DNR** - Public land maps, hunting/fishing regs
- **UP Engineers & Architects** - For buildability assessments

## Notes

**Key Insight:** Land is a long game. You're not just buying dirt—you're buying freedom, space, future optionality. The roadmap above assumes 35% down ($45k) as the target because it balances speed with smart financing.

**Flexibility:** If you find a killer deal at $80k (20 acres, perfect location), you could pivot and buy sooner with a smaller down payment. The roadmap is a guide, not a prison.

**Mindset:** Every $1,000 saved is 1-2 acres closer. Every side project that generates $500 is a week shaved off the timeline. Stack small wins.
