You're about to interview a customer.

You open a blank Google Doc. Cursor blinking. "What should I ask?"

If you've been there, you know the feeling: you don't want to waste their time with bad questions, but you also don't want to miss the insights that could change your product.

This guide fixes that.

Below are **50 proven customer interview questions**, organized by what you're trying to learn. Copy them. Customize them. Use them to have better conversations.

---

## How to Use This Question Bank

**Don't ask all 50 questions.** That's an interrogation, not an interview.

Instead:
1. **Pick a goal** (understanding pain points, validating features, etc.)
2. **Choose 5-7 questions** from that section
3. **Ask follow-ups** based on their answers (the best insights come from "tell me more about that")

**Golden rule:** Let them talk 80% of the time. Your job is to listen, not pitch.

---

## Section 1: Discovery Questions (Understanding the Problem)

**Goal:** Learn what challenges they face, how they currently solve them, and where your product might fit.

### 1. "What problem were you trying to solve when you found us?"
**Why it works:** Gets straight to their pain point without assuming you know it.

**Follow-up:** "How long have you had this problem?"

---

### 2. "Walk me through how you currently handle [specific task]."
**Why it works:** Shows their workflow, reveals hidden pain points.

**Follow-up:** "What's the most frustrating part of that process?"

---

### 3. "Before using our product, what alternatives did you try?"
**Why it works:** Reveals your real competitors (which might not be who you think).

**Follow-up:** "Why didn't those work for you?"

---

### 4. "What would happen if you couldn't solve this problem?"
**Why it works:** Measures urgency. If the answer is "not much," the problem isn't painful enough.

**Follow-up:** "How much does this problem cost you (time, money, stress)?"

---

### 5. "How often do you run into this issue?"
**Why it works:** Frequency = importance. Daily problems get solved. Monthly problems... maybe not.

**Follow-up:** "Is it always the same cause, or does it vary?"

---

### 6. "Who else on your team is affected by this problem?"
**Why it works:** Identifies stakeholders and decision-makers you might not know about.

**Follow-up:** "How do they currently work around it?"

---

### 7. "If you could wave a magic wand and fix one thing about [process], what would it be?"
**Why it works:** Forces them to prioritize. Their answer is your product roadmap.

**Follow-up:** "Why is that the most important?"

---

### 8. "What have you already tried to fix this problem?"
**Why it works:** Shows what they've invested in (time, money, effort). Higher investment = more pain.

**Follow-up:** "Why didn't that work?"

---

### 9. "When did you first notice this problem?"
**Why it works:** Reveals triggers. New role? Company growth? New competitor?

**Follow-up:** "What changed that made it a problem now?"

---

### 10. "How much time do you spend on [task] each week?"
**Why it works:** Quantifies the problem. "2 hours" is small. "15 hours" is a crisis.

**Follow-up:** "What could you do with that time if you got it back?"

---

## Section 2: Product Usage Questions (How They Use Your Product)

**Goal:** Understand how customers actually use your product (not how you think they use it).

### 11. "What was the first thing you did after signing up?"
**Why it works:** Reveals onboarding friction. If they didn't know what to do, others won't either.

**Follow-up:** "Was that easy, or did you get stuck anywhere?"

---

### 12. "How often do you use [product]?"
**Why it works:** Daily users are power users. Monthly users might churn soon.

**Follow-up:** "What triggers you to open the product?"

---

### 13. "What feature do you use most?"
**Why it works:** Tells you what to double down on (and what to kill).

**Follow-up:** "Why is that feature so important to you?"

---

### 14. "Is there a feature you wish you used more but don't?"
**Why it works:** Finds features that are valuable but hard to discover/use.

**Follow-up:** "What's stopping you from using it?"

---

### 15. "Have you integrated [product] into your workflow yet?"
**Why it works:** Integration = stickiness. If it's not in their workflow, they'll cancel.

**Follow-up:** "What would make it easier to integrate?"

---

### 16. "Do you use [product] alone or with your team?"
**Why it works:** Collaboration = expansion revenue. Solo users have lower LTV.

**Follow-up:** "If team: Who else uses it? What do they use it for?"

---

### 17. "What's one thing you wish you could do in [product] that you can't right now?"
**Why it works:** Direct feature request. If 10 people say the same thing, build it.

**Follow-up:** "How would that change your workflow?"

---

### 18. "Have you recommended [product] to anyone?"
**Why it works:** If yes = strong signal of product-market fit. If no = why not?

**Follow-up:** "What did you tell them about it?"

---

### 19. "If [product] disappeared tomorrow, what would you do?"
**Why it works:** Measures dependency. "I'd be screwed" = great. "I'd find something else" = not good.

**Follow-up:** "What would you miss most?"

---

### 20. "What almost made you not sign up?"
**Why it works:** Reveals objections that are stopping other prospects right now.

**Follow-up:** "What convinced you to try it anyway?"

---

## Section 3: Value & ROI Questions (Measuring Impact)

**Goal:** Quantify the value your product delivers (for case studies, pricing justification, sales).

### 21. "How much time does [product] save you each week/month?"
**Why it works:** Time = money. Specific numbers make great testimonials.

**Follow-up:** "What do you do with that saved time?"

---

### 22. "Can you estimate how much money [product] has saved you?"
**Why it works:** ROI in dollars is the strongest sales argument.

**Follow-up:** "How did you calculate that?"

---

### 23. "What's the biggest win you've had since using [product]?"
**Why it works:** Stories > features. This is your case study headline.

**Follow-up:** "Walk me through how that happened."

---

### 24. "How has [product] changed your day-to-day work?"
**Why it works:** Reveals unexpected benefits you didn't know you were providing.

**Follow-up:** "What surprised you most?"

---

### 25. "Before [product], how long did [task] take? How long does it take now?"
**Why it works:** Before/after comparison. "3 hours → 30 minutes" is powerful.

**Follow-up:** "What bottleneck did we remove?"

---

### 26. "Have you been able to take on more work/clients since using [product]?"
**Why it works:** Revenue expansion story. Great for consultants/agencies.

**Follow-up:** "How much more revenue is that?"

---

### 27. "What would it cost you to go back to your old process?"
**Why it works:** Switching cost = retention. If it's high, they won't churn.

**Follow-up:** "What would you lose?"

---

### 28. "Has [product] helped you avoid any mistakes or risks?"
**Why it works:** Risk mitigation is value, even if it's hard to quantify.

**Follow-up:** "Can you give an example?"

---

### 29. "How do you measure success with [product]?"
**Why it works:** Shows what metrics they care about (which you should track too).

**Follow-up:** "Are you hitting those goals?"

---

### 30. "If you had to put a dollar value on [product], what would it be worth to you?"
**Why it works:** Pricing research. If they say $200/month and you charge $50, raise prices.

**Follow-up:** "Why that amount?"

---

## Section 4: Feature Validation Questions (Testing New Ideas)

**Goal:** Validate new features before building them (save months of wasted dev time).

### 31. "If we built [feature], would you use it?"
**Why it works:** Simple yes/no. But dig deeper—talk is cheap.

**Follow-up:** "How often would you use it? What problem would it solve?"

---

### 32. "How are you currently solving [problem that feature would address]?"
**Why it works:** If they've built a workaround, the pain is real. If not, maybe it's not that important.

**Follow-up:** "How much time/money does that workaround cost?"

---

### 33. "Would [feature] replace a tool you're currently paying for?"
**Why it works:** If yes = expansion revenue opportunity. If no = nice-to-have.

**Follow-up:** "Which tool? How much do you pay for it?"

---

### 34. "If we launched [feature], what's the first thing you'd do with it?"
**Why it works:** Tests if they actually understand the feature and have a use case.

**Follow-up:** "Walk me through that workflow."

---

### 35. "Would you pay extra for [feature]?"
**Why it works:** Willingness to pay = true demand. "It'd be nice" ≠ "I'd pay for it."

**Follow-up:** "How much more?"

---

### 36. "Rank these three features by importance to you."
**Why it works:** Forces prioritization. Don't let them say "all three are important."

**Follow-up:** "Why is [top choice] most important?"

---

### 37. "If we only built one of these, which would have the biggest impact on your work?"
**Why it works:** Similar to #36, but framed as impact (not just preference).

**Follow-up:** "What would that impact look like?"

---

### 38. "What's missing from [product] that you need right now?"
**Why it works:** Open-ended. Lets them tell you the feature you didn't think to ask about.

**Follow-up:** "How urgently do you need that?"

---

### 39. "If [feature] took 6 months to build, would you wait for it or look for an alternative?"
**Why it works:** Measures patience (and urgency). If they'd leave, it's critical.

**Follow-up:** "What alternative would you consider?"

---

### 40. "Would you be willing to beta test [feature] if we built it?"
**Why it works:** If they say yes, you have a launch partner. If they say no, maybe they don't care that much.

**Follow-up:** "What would you want to see in the first version?"

---

## Section 5: Objection & Churn Questions (Understanding Hesitation)

**Goal:** Uncover objections, friction, and churn risk before it's too late.

### 41. "What almost made you cancel?"
**Why it works:** Reveals near-churn moments. Fix these to reduce future churn.

**Follow-up:** "What made you stay?"

---

### 42. "Is there anything about [product] that frustrates you?"
**Why it works:** Open-ended frustration question. They'll tell you what's broken.

**Follow-up:** "How often does that happen?"

---

### 43. "What would make [product] a no-brainer for you?"
**Why it works:** Shows what's missing from "good" to "can't live without."

**Follow-up:** "If we added that, would you upgrade?"

---

### 44. "Is [product] easy to use, or is there a learning curve?"
**Why it works:** UX feedback. If new users struggle, fix onboarding.

**Follow-up:** "What was hardest to learn?"

---

### 45. "Have you considered switching to a competitor?"
**Why it works:** Churn risk indicator. If yes, dig deep.

**Follow-up:** "What made you consider it? What's stopping you?"

---

### 46. "Is our pricing fair for the value you get?"
**Why it works:** Pricing validation. If they say "too expensive," you either need to add value or lower price.

**Follow-up:** "What would make it feel worth the price?"

---

### 47. "What would have to change for you to cancel?"
**Why it works:** Identifies red lines. Cross them = churn.

**Follow-up:** "How likely is that to happen?"

---

### 48. "Do you feel like you're getting your money's worth?"
**Why it works:** Value perception question. If no, they'll churn soon.

**Follow-up:** "What would make you feel like you are?"

---

### 49. "Is there anything we're not doing that you expected us to do?"
**Why it works:** Unmet expectations = dissatisfaction.

**Follow-up:** "Why did you expect that?"

---

### 50. "If you could give us one piece of advice, what would it be?"
**Why it works:** Broad, open-ended. Often gets the most honest feedback.

**Follow-up:** "Why is that important to you?"

## How to Structure a Great Customer Interview

Now that you have the questions, here's how to use them:

### Before the Interview:
1. **Define your goal** (discovery, feature validation, case study, etc.)
2. **Pick 5-7 questions** from the relevant sections above
3. **Prepare follow-ups** (but stay flexible—best insights come from unplanned follow-ups)
4. **Schedule 30-45 minutes** (not 15, not 90—just right)

### During the Interview:
1. **Start with context:** "Thanks for your time! I'm trying to understand [goal]. There are no wrong answers—I just want to learn from your experience."
2. **Ask open-ended questions** (avoid yes/no when possible)
3. **Let them talk 80% of the time** (resist the urge to pitch)
4. **Take notes** (or record with permission)
5. **Dig deeper on interesting points:** "Tell me more about that"

### After the Interview:
1. **Thank them** (email within 24 hours)
2. **Summarize key insights** (while it's fresh)
3. **Share findings with your team** (don't let insights die in a doc)
4. **Take action** (interviews are useless if you don't do something with them)

## Common Interview Mistakes (And How to Avoid Them)

### Mistake 1: Leading Questions
**Bad:** "Don't you think [feature] would be useful?"  
**Good:** "How would [feature] fit into your workflow?"

**Why:** Leading questions get you the answer you want, not the truth.

---

### Mistake 2: Asking Hypotheticals
**Bad:** "If we built X, would you use it?"  
**Good:** "How are you currently solving [problem]?"

**Why:** People lie about what they'd do. Ask what they actually do.

---

### Mistake 3: Pitching Instead of Listening
**Bad:** "Oh, we're actually building that! Let me tell you about it..."  
**Good:** "Interesting. Tell me more about why you need that."

**Why:** You're there to learn, not sell. Save the pitch for sales calls.

---

### Mistake 4: Not Recording
**Bad:** Trusting your memory and scrambled notes  
**Good:** "Do you mind if I record this so I don't miss anything?"

**Why:** You'll forget 80% of what was said. Record it.

---

### Mistake 5: Interviewing the Wrong People
**Bad:** Talking only to happy, engaged customers  
**Good:** Talk to new users, churned users, and power users

**Why:** Happy customers give you false confidence. Churned customers tell you why you're failing.

## Turning Interviews Into Content

Once you've done the interview, don't let it die in a doc.

Turn it into:
- **Case study** (their success story)
- **Testimonial** (pull the best quotes)
- **Feature roadmap** (prioritize what they asked for)
- **Social posts** (share their wins)
- **Email content** (use their language in copy)
- **Sales scripts** (use their pain points in pitches)

**Pro tip:** Use a tool like [Call-Content](https://call-content.com) to auto-generate all of this from your interview transcript in 10 minutes.

## The Bottom Line

Great customer interviews start with great questions.

But the questions don't matter if you don't:
1. **Actually listen** (80/20 rule—they talk, you listen)
2. **Take action** (insights are worthless without execution)
3. **Do it consistently** (one interview = data point; ten interviews = pattern)

Copy the questions above. Customize them for your product. Schedule your next interview.

Then go build something people actually want.

---

**Next Steps:**
1. Pick 5-7 questions from this list
2. Schedule an interview this week
3. Record it, transcribe it, and pull out the insights
4. Share what you learned with your team
5. Do it again next week
