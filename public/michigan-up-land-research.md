- [ ] Check Zillow land listings
- [ ] Check Realtor.com land section

- [ ] Alger County (Pictured Rocks area, premium)
- [ ] Baraga County (affordable, rural)

### Factors to Consider
- **Accessibility:** Year-round road access? Plowed in winter?

### Lenders Known for Land Loans
- [ ] Farm Credit Services

- [ ] USDA loans (if qualifies as rural/agricultural)

### Loan Details to Compare

## Next Steps for Drew

### Information Gathering (before building roadmap)
1. **Current financial snapshot:**
   - How much saved now for down payment?
   - Monthly income (FedEx + Erate consulting)?
   - Monthly expenses / how much can save?
   - Other debts/obligations?

2. **Land preferences:**
   - What area of UP? (affects pricing)
   - Must-haves: road access? utilities? water access?
   - Use case: build cabin immediately? Buy and hold?
   - Timeline flexibility?

3. **Financing research:**
   - Get pre-qualified with a lender (see what down payment they actually require)
   - Compare rates (land loan vs construction loan if building soon)

### Savings Acceleration Ideas
Based on Drew's skills (Flutter dev, web dev, business/tech background):

**Consulting/Freelance (fastest path to extra $1-3k/month):**
- Upwork/Toptal for Flutter mobile dev projects
- Web development for small businesses
- Tech consulting for startups (he has business informatics degree)

**Passive/Semi-Passive Income:**
- Build a SaaS product (recurring revenue)
- Mobile app with ads/subscriptions (leverage Flutter skills)
- Digital product/course (teach Flutter or web dev)
- Rental property (but need capital first - this is after land purchase)

**Optimize Existing Income:**
- Negotiate raise at FedEx (how long has he been there?)
- Expand Erate consulting hours/rate
- Find 1-2 more clients like Erate
