## FAQ Section

### Headline
**Frequently Asked Questions**

#### 1. Do I need to provide a transcript, or can you transcribe calls?

## Implementation Notes

### Design Recommendations
1. **Hero:** Full-screen with demo video background (record 60-second explainer)
2. **ROI Calculator:** Interactive, updates in real-time, prominent CTA below output
3. **Testimonials:** Rotating carousel with customer photos/logos
4. **Pricing Table:** Sticky header on scroll, highlight Professional tier with color/shadow
5. **Comparison Table:** Expandable rows for mobile, checkmark animations on load
6. **FAQ:** Accordion UI, expand/collapse, search functionality
7. **Exit-Intent:** Modal overlay with countdown timer (10 min urgency)

### A/B Test Ideas
- **Headline:** "Turn Calls Into Campaigns" vs. "Save 10 Hours Per Transcript"
- **CTA:** "Start Free Trial" vs. "Try Free for 14 Days"
- **Pricing:** Show monthly vs. annual by default
- **Social Proof:** Customer logos vs. testimonials vs. usage stats ("2,000+ transcripts processed")

### Urgency/Scarcity Elements (use sparingly)
- "200 spots left for founding member pricing" (if true)
- "50% off ends Feb 15" (launch promo)
- Exit-intent: "Offer expires in 10 minutes" (timer resets per session)

4. Record demo video (60-90 seconds)
5. Set up exit-intent popup logic
6. Configure analytics (Mixpanel/PostHog events)
