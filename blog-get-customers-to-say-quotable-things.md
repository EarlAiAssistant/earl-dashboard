## Introduction

You've seen those case studies with amazing customer quotes:

> "This tool saved me 20 hours a week. I don't know how I lived without it."

> "Within 30 days, we went from chaos to complete clarity. Game-changer."

> "I told my team, 'Drop everything — we're switching to this today.'"

**Those quotes didn't happen by accident.**

The customer didn't spontaneously deliver a perfect sound bite. The interviewer *pulled it out of them* with the right questions, at the right time, in the right way.

**This guide will show you exactly how to do that.**

You'll learn:
- Why most customer interviews produce boring quotes
- The psychology of getting people to open up
- Specific question frameworks that work
- Real examples of good vs. bad questions
- How to rescue a flat interview

By the end, you'll know how to turn any customer conversation into a goldmine of quotable moments.

## Why Most Customer Quotes Are Boring

Let's start with what *doesn't* work.

### **Bad Question #1: "Did you like our product?"**

**Customer's answer:** "Yeah, it's good."

**What you wanted:** A passionate endorsement.

**What you got:** A shrug.

---

### **Bad Question #2: "Can you describe your experience?"**

**Customer's answer:** "It was fine. Pretty easy to use."

**What you wanted:** A story about transformation.

**What you got:** Generic feedback that could apply to anything.

---

### **Bad Question #3: "Would you recommend us?"**

**Customer's answer:** "Sure, I'd recommend you."

**What you wanted:** A compelling reason *why* they'd recommend you.

**What you got:** Polite agreement.

---

**The problem with these questions:**
- They're **closed-ended** (yes/no answers)
- They're **leading** (customers say what they think you want to hear)
- They're **vague** (no specifics, no emotion)

**Great quotes come from great questions.** And great questions have three things in common:

1. **Open-ended** (can't be answered with yes/no)
2. **Specific** (ask about one moment, not "the whole experience")
3. **Emotional** (tap into how they felt, not just what happened)

---

## The Psychology of Getting People to Open Up

People don't naturally talk in sound bites. You have to create the conditions for it.

### **Principle #1: People Remember Stories, Not Facts**

**Bad question:** "What features do you use?"

**Good question:** "Tell me about the moment you realized this was going to work for you."

The second question prompts a **story** — and stories are naturally quotable.

---

### **Principle #2: Specificity Unlocks Emotion**

**Bad question:** "How do you feel about the product?"

**Good question:** "Think back to your first week using this. What surprised you?"

Asking about a **specific moment** forces them to relive it — and emotion comes through.

---

### **Principle #3: Silence Is Your Friend**

Most interviewers talk too much. They ask a question, the customer gives a short answer, and the interviewer immediately asks another question.

**Instead:**

1. Ask an open-ended question
2. Let the customer answer
3. **Stay silent for 2-3 seconds after they finish**
4. They'll often keep talking — and that's where the gold is

**Example:**

**You:** "What was the biggest challenge you were facing before this?"

**Customer:** "We were spending too much time on manual tasks."

**You:** [Silence]

**Customer:** "Actually, it was more than that. I'd stay up until midnight trying to catch up, and I'd still fall behind. I remember one night my wife asked me, 'Is this job worth it?' That's when I knew something had to change."

**That's the quote.** But you wouldn't have gotten it if you'd jumped in with another question.

---

### **Principle #4: Ask "Why" and "How" (Not "What")**

**"What" questions** get you facts:  
*"What features do you use?"* → "The reporting dashboard."

**"How" questions** get you process:  
*"How has your workflow changed?"* → "I used to spend 5 hours a week on reports. Now it's automated."

**"Why" questions** get you emotion and motivation:  
*"Why did you decide to try this?"* → "I was desperate. I couldn't keep going the way things were."

**For quotable moments, lead with "how" and "why."**

---

## The Best Question Frameworks (Copy These)

Here are proven question types that consistently generate great quotes:

---

### **1. The "Before/After" Question**

**Template:** "What was your [specific task/process] like before vs. now?"

**Example:**

**You:** "What was your onboarding process like before you started using this?"

**Customer:** "It was a nightmare. Every new customer required a manual setup. I'd spend 3-4 hours configuring their account, importing data, and sending them instructions. And half the time, they'd still email me asking for help. Now? They sign up, the system sets them up automatically, and they're live in 10 minutes. I went from spending 20 hours a week on onboarding to maybe 2."

**Why this works:** You get a clear before/after comparison with specific details.

---

### **2. The "Moment of Realization" Question**

**Template:** "When did you realize this was actually going to work for you?"

**Example:**

**You:** "When did you have that 'aha' moment where you thought, 'Okay, this is going to solve my problem'?"

**Customer:** "It was the second week. I ran my first automated report, and it pulled everything I needed — data I used to spend hours compiling manually. I just sat there staring at it like, 'Wait, that's it? I'm done?' I remember calling my co-founder and saying, 'We need to switch everything to this immediately.'"

**Why this works:** You get the exact moment, the emotion, and often a great quote.

---

### **3. The "What Almost Stopped You" Question**

**Template:** "What almost made you *not* try this?"

**Example:**

**You:** "Before you signed up, was there anything that almost stopped you?"

**Customer:** "Honestly? The price. I thought, 'Do I really need another subscription?' But then I did the math. If this saved me even 5 hours a month, it'd pay for itself. And it's saved way more than that."

**Why this works:** You uncover objections (useful for sales) and get to the "why I did it anyway" moment (useful for case studies).

---

### **4. The "If You Had to Explain This to a Friend" Question**

**Template:** "If a friend asked you what this is and why you use it, what would you say?"

**Example:**

**You:** "Imagine a friend of yours is in the same situation you were in six months ago. How would you describe this tool to them?"

**Customer:** "I'd say, 'Look, you're drowning in spreadsheets and manual work. This automates all of it. You set it up once, and it runs forever. I got 15 hours of my week back. You need this.'"

**Why this works:** People naturally simplify and get conversational when explaining to a peer. That's the tone you want.

---

### **5. The "Unexpected Benefit" Question**

**Template:** "What's something you didn't expect when you started using this?"

**Example:**

**You:** "What surprised you — good or bad?"

**Customer:** "I didn't expect it to help with team morale. Before, everyone was stressed because we were always behind. Now that onboarding is automated, the team can focus on actually helping customers instead of just setting up accounts. People are happier."

**Why this works:** Unexpected benefits are more interesting than expected ones. These make great pull-quotes.

---

### **6. The "One Sentence" Question**

**Template:** "If you had to sum up your experience in one sentence, what would you say?"

**Example:**

**You:** "If you could only say one sentence about this, what would it be?"

**Customer:** "It gave me my life back."

**Why this works:** Forces them to distill everything into one punchy line — perfect for social media, testimonials, or case study headlines.

---

### **7. The "Advice to Past You" Question**

**Template:** "If you could go back and talk to yourself six months ago, what would you say?"

**Example:**

**You:** "What advice would you give to someone who's in the same position you were in before using this?"

**Customer:** "I'd say, 'Stop trying to do everything manually. You're wasting time and burning out. Just automate it and move on.'"

**Why this works:** People give direct, actionable advice when framed this way — and it doubles as social proof.

---

### **8. The "Worst-Case Scenario" Question**

**Template:** "What would've happened if you *hadn't* solved this problem?"

**Example:**

**You:** "If you hadn't found a solution, where do you think you'd be right now?"

**Customer:** "I probably would've quit. Seriously. I was working 60-hour weeks, and it still wasn't enough. I was headed for burnout. This literally saved my job."

**Why this works:** Stakes make stories compelling. If the problem wasn't serious, the solution isn't impressive.

---

## Real Examples: Good vs. Bad Questions

Let's compare how the same conversation can go two different ways:

---

### **Scenario: Interviewing a Customer About Time Savings**

#### **Bad Version (Generic, Closed Questions)**

**You:** "Did the product save you time?"  
**Customer:** "Yeah, definitely."

**You:** "How much time?"  
**Customer:** "Maybe 10 hours a week."

**You:** "That's great. Do you like it?"  
**Customer:** "Yeah, it's good."

**Result:** No quotable moments. Boring.

---

#### **Good Version (Open, Specific Questions)**

**You:** "Walk me through what a typical week looked like before you started using this."

**Customer:** "Oh man, it was chaos. I'd spend Monday and Tuesday just trying to catch up on the manual data entry from the week before. By Wednesday, I'd be behind again. I was staying late every night, and I still couldn't keep up."

**You:** "What changed after you started using the tool?"

**Customer:** "Everything. The stuff that used to take me 10 hours is now automated. I set it up once, and it runs in the background. I went from working until 9 PM every night to leaving at 5:30. My wife actually asked me, 'Did you get fired?' because I was home on time."

**You:** [Silence]

**Customer:** "Honestly, I should've done this two years ago. I wasted so much time trying to build my own solution. This just works."

**Result:** Multiple quotable moments:
- "I went from working until 9 PM to leaving at 5:30."
- "My wife asked me, 'Did you get fired?' because I was home on time."
- "I should've done this two years ago."

## How to Rescue a Flat Interview

Sometimes, despite your best questions, the customer gives short, flat answers.

**Here's how to turn it around:**

---

### **Tactic #1: Ask Them to Tell a Story**

**You:** "Can you think of a specific time when this tool saved the day?"

**Why this works:** Stories are easier to tell than abstract descriptions.

---

### **Tactic #2: Dig Into the Details**

**Customer:** "It made things easier."

**You:** "What do you mean by easier? Walk me through a specific example."

**Why this works:** Vague answers become specific when you ask for an example.

---

### **Tactic #3: Ask What They'd Tell Their Boss**

**You:** "If your boss asked you to justify the cost of this tool, what would you say?"

**Why this works:** People get concrete when they have to defend a decision.

---

### **Tactic #4: Flip the Script — Ask About Frustrations**

**You:** "Was there anything frustrating about getting started?"

**Why this works:** People are often more animated when talking about problems. Once they open up, you can steer back to the positive.

---

### **Tactic #5: Use the "Help Me Understand" Prompt**

**Customer:** "It's just better."

**You:** "Help me understand what you mean by 'better.' What's different now compared to before?"

**Why this works:** People want to be helpful. This phrase invites them to explain further.

---

## Advanced Tactics: Going Deeper

Once you've mastered the basics, here are advanced techniques:

---

### **1. The "Double-Click" Method**

When a customer says something interesting, **don't move on. Double-click on it.**

**Customer:** "This changed how we operate."

**You:** "That's interesting. Tell me more about that."

**Customer:** "Well, before, we were reactive. Always putting out fires. Now we're proactive. We can see problems before they blow up."

**You:** "Can you give me an example of a time that happened?"

**Customer:** "Last week, the dashboard flagged a customer who was at risk of churning. We reached out, fixed their issue, and they ended up upgrading. We never would've caught that before."

**Now you have:** A specific story, not just a vague claim.

---

### **2. The "Contrast" Question**

**Template:** "What's one thing that's better now, and one thing that was easier before?"

**Why this works:** Asking for a downside makes the answer feel balanced and honest — which builds trust. And sometimes, the "downside" is actually a benefit in disguise.

**Example:**

**Customer:** "The only downside is that it's so automated, I sometimes forget to check it. But honestly, that's kind of the point — it just works without me."

---

### **3. The "Quantify This" Question**

When a customer makes a claim, ask them to put a number on it.

**Customer:** "This saved us so much time."

**You:** "If you had to guess, how many hours per week?"

**Customer:** "Probably 15-20 hours across the team."

**You:** "Wow. What are you doing with that time now?"

**Customer:** "We're actually talking to customers instead of just managing spreadsheets."

**Result:** A before/after that's both quantitative (15-20 hours) and qualitative (better customer relationships).

---

### **4. The "Time Machine" Question**

**Template:** "If you could go back to the day before you signed up and give yourself one piece of advice, what would it be?"

**Why this works:** It's a creative way to get at lessons learned and regrets (which are quotable).

---

### **5. The "What If" Question**

**Template:** "What if you had to stop using this tomorrow? What would happen?"

**Why this works:** It forces them to articulate the value by imagining life without it.

**Example:**

**Customer:** "Oh man, we'd be screwed. We'd have to hire two more people just to handle what this automates. It'd cost us $150K a year, easy."

- **Zoom's built-in transcription** (free, decent quality)
- **Otter.ai** (free for 600 min/month, high accuracy)
- **Call-Content** (built for customer interview content)

- One-liners
- Before/after comparisons
- Specific numbers
- Emotional moments
- Surprising insights

---

### **3. Edit for Clarity (But Keep the Voice)**

People don't speak in perfect sentences. It's okay to clean up quotes:

**Raw transcript:**
> "Yeah, so, um, the thing is, we were spending, like, a lot of time on, you know, manual stuff, and it was just, uh, really frustrating."

**Edited for blog/case study:**
> "We were spending a lot of time on manual tasks, and it was really frustrating."

**What to keep:**
- Their unique phrasing
- Emotion
- Specifics

**What to remove:**
- "Um," "uh," "like," "you know"
- Repetition
- Tangents

---

### **4. Use Quotes Everywhere**

A great quote can be repurposed into:
- **Case study** (the backbone of the story)
- **Testimonial page** (social proof)
- **Social media post** (make it a graphic)
- **Email campaign** (use in nurture sequences)
- **Sales deck** (objection handling)
- **Website copy** (hero section, feature pages)

## Common Mistakes (And How to Avoid Them)

### **Mistake #1: Asking Leading Questions**

❌ **Bad:** "You love the product, right?"

✅ **Good:** "How do you feel about the product?"

**Why:** Leading questions make customers say what they think you want to hear, not what they actually think.

---

### **Mistake #2: Talking Too Much**

You're the interviewer, not the interviewee. Your job is to ask great questions and shut up.

**Fix:** Aim for an 80/20 split — the customer talks 80% of the time, you talk 20%.

---

### **Mistake #3: Not Following Up on Interesting Answers**

Customer says something intriguing, and you move on to the next question. **Don't.**

**Fix:** When you hear something good, dig deeper with "Tell me more about that" or "Can you give me an example?"

---

### **Mistake #4: Skipping the Silence**

**Fix:** After the customer finishes answering, wait 2-3 seconds before asking the next question. They'll often keep talking — and that's where the gold is.

---

### **Mistake #5: Not Recording the Interview**

**Fix:** Always record (with permission). You can't capture great quotes if you're scrambling to take notes.

---
