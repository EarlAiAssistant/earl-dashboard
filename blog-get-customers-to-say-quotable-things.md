## The Problem: Bland, Unusable Customer Quotes

You've scheduled the perfect customer interview. You've got 30 minutes with someone who loves your product. You're pumped.

**Then you ask:** "So, how's the product working for you?"

**They say:** "Yeah, it's good. We like it."

**You probe:** "What do you like most about it?"

**They say:** "Uh, it's just... easier, you know?"

You end the call with 30 minutes of vague, unusable fluff. No metrics. No emotion. No quotes you can put on your homepage.

Sound familiar?

**Here's the truth:** Most customers aren't naturally quotable. They won't volunteer the gold you're looking for. You have to **extract it** with the right questions.

This guide shows you how to get customers to say things like:

- "This saved us 20 hours a week — I don't know how we lived without it."
- "We tried three other tools and they all sucked. This is the only one that actually works."
- "My boss asked how I got so fast. I just said 'magic.'"

**The difference?** Better questions + better prompts.

## Why Most Customer Quotes Suck

Before we fix it, let's diagnose the problem.

**Bad quote:**  
> "The product is great. We're happy with it. Would recommend."

**Why it's bad:**
- ❌ Vague ("great," "happy" — means nothing)
- ❌ No emotion (sounds like a press release)
- ❌ No specifics (what improved? how much? when?)
- ❌ Generic (could be about any product)

**Good quote:**  
> "Before Call-Content, I was spending 8 hours a week writing case studies. Now it takes 30 minutes. I literally got 7.5 hours of my life back every week."

**Why it's good:**
- ✅ Specific numbers (8 hours → 30 minutes)
- ✅ Before/after comparison (shows transformation)
- ✅ Emotional language ("got my life back")
- ✅ Relatable (readers think "I want that too")

**The difference?** The second one answers **how** and **how much** — not just "it's good."

## The 5 Types of Quotable Moments (And How to Trigger Them)

Great customer quotes fall into 5 categories. Here's how to extract each one.

---

### 1. **Before/After Comparisons**

**What you want:**  
> "We used to [old painful way]... now we [new easy way]."

**Why it works:**  
Transformation is the heart of every good story. Before/after shows contrast.

**How to get it:**

**❌ Bad question:**  
"How's the product working for you?"

**✅ Good question:**  
"What was the process like **before** you started using [Product]? Walk me through a typical day."

**Follow-up:**  
"And what does that process look like **now**?"

**Real example:**

**Question:** "What did customer research look like before Call-Content?"

**Response:**  
> "Before? Chaos. I'd record a Zoom call, manually transcribe it — which took forever — then spend another 4 hours writing a case study. By the time I published it, the insights were already outdated. Now I just upload the recording and get a draft in 5 minutes. It's night and day."

**Why it worked:**
- Specific process (record → transcribe → write)
- Time comparison (4 hours → 5 minutes)
- Emotional language ("chaos," "night and day")

---

### 2. **Quantifiable Results**

**What you want:**  
> "We saved [X hours], gained [Y revenue], or improved [Z metric]."

**Why it works:**  
Numbers are proof. "We're faster" is vague. "We're 3x faster" is concrete.

**How to get it:**

**❌ Bad question:**  
"Has this improved your workflow?"

**✅ Good question:**  
"If you had to guess, how many hours per week does this save you? Even a rough estimate is fine."

**Follow-up:**  
"What does that translate to in dollar value? Like, what could you do with that extra time?"

**Real example:**

**Question:** "How much time does Call-Content save you each week?"

**Response:**  
> "Probably 15-20 hours a month. At my hourly rate, that's about $3,000 in opportunity cost. I can now spend that time on product development instead of writing case studies."

**Why it worked:**
- Specific range (15-20 hours/month)
- Dollar value ($3,000)
- Reallocation explanation (what they do with the time)

**Pro tip:** If they don't know the number, **give them options**:

> "Would you say it's closer to 5 hours a week, 10 hours, or more like 20?"

Most people will pick one and then refine it.

---

### 3. **Emotional Reactions**

**What you want:**  
> "I was [frustrated/overwhelmed/skeptical]... then [aha moment]."

**Why it works:**  
Emotion = relatability. Prospects feel what the customer felt.

**How to get it:**

**❌ Bad question:**  
"What do you think about the product?"

**✅ Good question:**  
"How did you **feel** when you first saw the results? Like, what was your reaction?"

**Follow-up:**  
"Was there a moment where you thought, 'Oh wow, this actually works'?"

**Real example:**

**Question:** "What was your reaction the first time you used Call-Content?"

**Response:**  
> "Honestly, I thought it would be garbage. I was like, 'There's no way AI can write a good case study.' But then I uploaded a call and... it was actually good? I didn't believe it at first. I kept re-reading the draft like, 'Did I just save 6 hours?'"

**Why it worked:**
- Skepticism (relatable — most people doubt AI)
- Surprise ("I didn't believe it")
- Visceral reaction ("Did I just save 6 hours?")

**Pro tip:** Silence is powerful. After asking "How did you feel?", **shut up and let them talk.** Don't fill the silence.

---

### 4. **Comparison to Alternatives**

**What you want:**  
> "We tried [Competitor A] and [Competitor B], but they didn't [solve the problem]. [Your Product] was the only one that [specific thing]."

**Why it works:**  
It positions your product as the winner in a real-world bake-off.

**How to get it:**

**❌ Bad question:**  
"Why did you choose us?"

**✅ Good question:**  
"What else did you try before finding [Product]? What didn't work about those?"

**Follow-up:**  
"What made [Product] different? What was the deciding factor?"

**Real example:**

**Question:** "Did you try any other tools before Call-Content?"

**Response:**  
> "Yeah, we tried Otter.ai and Fireflies. Both are great for transcription, but they don't actually **write** anything. I'd still have to spend 4 hours turning the transcript into a case study. Call-Content was the only one that did the whole thing end-to-end."

**Why it worked:**
- Named competitors (Otter, Fireflies)
- Explained why they fell short (transcription ≠ writing)
- Highlighted unique value (end-to-end solution)

**Pro tip:** Mentioning competitors by name is powerful. It shows the customer did their homework and **still** picked you.

---

### 5. **Unexpected Benefits**

**What you want:**  
> "I didn't expect [benefit], but it turned out to be [huge win]."

**Why it works:**  
Surprises are memorable. They show value beyond the obvious pitch.

**How to get it:**

**❌ Bad question:**  
"What features do you like?"

**✅ Good question:**  
"What surprised you? Like, what benefit did you **not** expect when you first signed up?"

**Follow-up:**  
"Was there anything you thought was a 'nice-to-have' that turned out to be a game-changer?"

**Real example:**

**Question:** "Was there anything about Call-Content that surprised you?"

**Response:**  
> "Yeah, the SEO. I didn't realize the case studies would rank on Google, but we're now getting 500 organic visitors a month from them. That wasn't even on my radar when I signed up — I just wanted to save time. But the traffic is huge."

**Why it worked:**
- Unexpected benefit (SEO, not just time savings)
- Quantifiable (500 visitors/month)
- Reveals hidden ROI (traffic = leads)

**Pro tip:** This question almost always produces gold because people love sharing discoveries.

## The Interview Framework: 7 Questions That Always Work

Here's a plug-and-play framework for extracting quotable moments.

### **1. The Struggle Question**
> "Walk me through what life looked like **before** you found [Product]. What was the biggest pain point?"

**Goal:** Get them to paint a vivid picture of the problem.

---

### **2. The Breaking Point Question**
> "Was there a specific moment where you thought, 'I can't keep doing this'? What happened?"

**Goal:** Extract emotional stakes (frustration, overwhelm, urgency).

---

### **3. The Discovery Question**
> "How did you find us? What made you click?"

**Goal:** Understand their buying journey (useful for marketing).

---

### **4. The Skepticism Question**
> "Were you skeptical at first? What were you worried wouldn't work?"

**Goal:** Surface objections (so you can address them in marketing).

---

### **5. The Aha Moment Question**
> "When did it click for you? Was there a moment where you thought, 'Oh, this actually works'?"

**Goal:** Capture the emotional turning point.

---

### **6. The Quantifiable Impact Question**
> "If you had to estimate, how much time/money/effort has this saved you? Even a rough guess is fine."

**Goal:** Get concrete numbers (time saved, revenue gained, etc.).

---

### **7. The Surprise Question**
> "What surprised you most? Was there a benefit you didn't expect?"

**Goal:** Uncover unexpected value (often the best marketing angle).

---

## Advanced Techniques: 4 Ways to Make Customers More Quotable

### **1. Use Hypotheticals**

If they're being vague, make it concrete.

**Example:**  
> **You:** "If a friend asked you what changed after using [Product], what would you tell them?"

This forces them to simplify and get to the core benefit.

---

### **2. Ask for Analogies**

**Example:**  
> **You:** "How would you describe [Product] to someone who's never heard of it? Like, what's it similar to?"

Analogies are inherently quotable:
- "It's like Grammarly for customer research."
- "Think of it as ChatGPT, but it actually understands your business."

---

### **3. Reflect Back What You Heard**

**Example:**  
> **Them:** "Yeah, it's just... way easier now."  
> **You:** "So it sounds like you went from spending 10 hours a week to basically nothing. Is that right?"  
> **Them:** "Exactly! I'd say it's more like 30 minutes now."

You just turned "easier" into "10 hours → 30 minutes."

---

### **4. Let Them Complain**

**Example:**  
> **You:** "What almost made you **not** sign up? Like, what were you on the fence about?"

Complaints reveal pain points:
> "I almost didn't try it because I thought AI would sound robotic. But the case studies actually sound human."

That's a testimonial disguised as a complaint.

---

## Common Mistakes (And How to Fix Them)

### ❌ **Mistake #1: Asking Yes/No Questions**

**Bad:**  
> "Do you like the product?"

**Good:**  
> "What's your favorite thing about the product?"

**Why:** Yes/no questions kill momentum. Open-ended questions get stories.

---

### ❌ **Mistake #2: Interrupting**

**What happens:**  
> **Them:** "Yeah, so before we—"  
> **You:** "Oh, did you try [Competitor]?"

**Why it's bad:** You just cut off a potential gold nugget.

**Fix:** Shut up. Let them finish. Take notes instead of talking.

---

### ❌ **Mistake #3: Leading the Witness**

**Bad:**  
> "You love how fast it is, right?"

**Why it's bad:** You're putting words in their mouth.

**Good:**  
> "What stands out to you most?"

Let them pick the angle. Sometimes it's speed. Sometimes it's accuracy. Sometimes it's something you didn't expect.

---

### ❌ **Mistake #4: Not Recording**

If you rely on memory, you'll miss the best quotes.

**Fix:** Always record (with permission). Use:
- Zoom's auto-transcription
- Otter.ai
- Fireflies.ai

Then scan the transcript for quotable moments after the call.

---
