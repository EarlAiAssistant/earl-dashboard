You're about to interview a customer.

You want actionable insights. Quotable moments. Data for case studies.

But you're worried you'll:
- Ask the wrong questions
- Miss the good stuff
- Get generic answers
- Waste their time

This guide gives you 15 proven best practices to run customer interviews that actually produce valuable content.

---

## Before the Interview

### 1. Define Your Goal (Don't Skip This)

**Why it matters:** Interviews without a clear goal become meandering conversations that produce nothing useful.

**Good goals:**
- ✅ "Get metrics for a case study"
- ✅ "Understand pain points for messaging"
- ✅ "Validate new feature idea"
- ✅ "Extract testimonial quotes"

**Bad goals:**
- ❌ "Learn about their experience" (too vague)
- ❌ "Just chat" (not actionable)

**Action:**
Before scheduling, write one sentence: "I'm interviewing [Customer] to [specific goal]."

---

### 2. Pick the Right Customer

**Not all customers make good interviewees.**

**Great interview candidates:**
- ✅ Power users (use product daily/weekly)
- ✅ Recent success stories (achieved measurable results)
- ✅ Clear communicators (can articulate their experience)
- ✅ Willing to go on record (comfortable being quoted)

**Poor interview candidates:**
- ❌ Brand new users (haven't experienced value yet)
- ❌ Churned customers (unless goal is to understand why they left)
- ❌ Passive users (log in once a month)

**Action:**
Look for customers who:
1. Have been using your product for 1-6 months (long enough for results, short enough to remember details)
2. Have achieved specific, measurable outcomes
3. Are willing to share publicly (ask upfront)

---

### 3. Prepare 5-7 Questions (Not 20)

**Why it matters:** More questions ≠ better interview. You need time for follow-ups.

**Structure:**
- 2 questions about the problem (before using your product)
- 2-3 questions about the solution (how they use your product)
- 2 questions about results (what changed)

**Example set:**
1. "What problem were you trying to solve when you found us?"
2. "How were you handling [task] before using our product?"
3. "Walk me through how you use [product] today."
4. "What feature do you use most? Why?"
5. "What's changed since you started using [product]?"
6. "Can you quantify the impact? (time saved, money earned, etc.)"
7. "If [product] disappeared tomorrow, what would you do?"

**Action:**
Write 5-7 questions. Leave room for follow-ups.

---

### 4. Ask Permission to Record

**Why it matters:** You can't take notes fast enough. Recording lets you focus on listening.

**How to ask:**
> "Would it be okay if I record this call? I like to review conversations and may use some of your insights in our marketing (with your permission, of course). Is that alright?"

**95% of people say yes.**

**If they say no:**
- Take detailed notes
- Ask if you can share key quotes later for approval

**Action:**
Always ask. Most say yes. Recording = better content later.

---

### 5. Schedule 30-45 Minutes (Not 15, Not 90)

**Why it matters:**
- 15 minutes: Not enough time for depth
- 90 minutes: Too long, you'll lose them

**Sweet spot: 30-45 minutes**
- First 5 min: Warm-up, context
- Next 25-35 min: Core questions + follow-ups
- Last 5 min: Wrap-up, next steps

**Action:**
When scheduling, say: "I'd love 30-45 minutes of your time. Does [date/time] work?"

---

## During the Interview

### 6. Start With Context, Not a Pitch

**Bad opening:**
> "Thanks for your time! Before we start, let me tell you about our new feature..."

**Good opening:**
> "Thanks for joining! I'm trying to understand how [Product] fits into your workflow. There are no wrong answers—I just want to learn from your experience. Sound good?"

**Why it works:**
- Sets expectations (this is about them, not a sales pitch)
- Reduces pressure ("no wrong answers")
- Makes them comfortable

**Action:**
First 2 minutes = set the stage. Then dive into questions.

---

### 7. Let Them Talk 80% of the Time

**The golden rule:** You should talk 20%, they should talk 80%.

**If you're talking more than 20%:**
- You're pitching (not listening)
- You're leading them to answers
- You're missing insights

**How to hit 80/20:**
- Ask open-ended questions
- Resist the urge to fill silence
- Use follow-ups: "Tell me more about that"

**Action:**
After the call, estimate: Did they talk 80%? If not, adjust next time.

---

### 8. Dig Deeper With Follow-Ups

**The best insights don't come from your prepared questions.**

**They come from follow-ups.**

**Example:**

**Question:** "What problem were you trying to solve?"  
**Answer:** "We were spending too much time on reports."

**Bad follow-up (or none):** Move to next question.

**Good follow-up:** "How much time? What was the impact of that?"

**Better answer:** "About 15 hours a week. It meant I couldn't take on new clients. I was turning down $50k in potential work because I was buried in spreadsheets."

**See the difference?** The follow-up got you specific numbers and emotional weight.

**Magic follow-up phrases:**
- "Tell me more about that."
- "Why was that important?"
- "Can you give me an example?"
- "How did that make you feel?"
- "What would've happened if you couldn't solve that?"

**Action:**
Prepare 5-7 questions. Plan to ask 15-20 follow-ups.

---

### 9. Ask for Specifics (Not Generalities)

**Vague answers don't make good content.**

**Vague:**
- "It saves us time."
- "We're more productive."
- "It's made a big difference."

**Specific:**
- "It saves us 13 hours per week."
- "We shipped 3 features in Q1 vs. 1 in Q4."
- "We closed $180k in new business this quarter."

**How to get specifics:**

**When they say:** "It saves us time."  
**You ask:** "How much time? Per week or per month?"

**When they say:** "We're more productive."  
**You ask:** "Can you quantify that? What can you do now that you couldn't before?"

**When they say:** "It's made a big difference."  
**You ask:** "What changed specifically? Do you have numbers?"

**Action:**
Every time you hear a generality, ask: "Can you be more specific?"

---

### 10. Capture Quotable Moments

**You're not just gathering data. You're collecting quotes.**

**What makes a good quote:**
- Emotional ("This changed how we do business")
- Specific ("We saved 13 hours a week")
- Conversational (sounds like a real person talking)

**When you hear a great quote:**
- Make a note: "⭐ QUOTE"
- Ask them to repeat it (if recording failed)
- Ask permission: "Can I quote you on that?"

**Examples of quotable moments:**
> "This tool saved us 13 hours a week. We reinvested that time into growth and closed $180k in new business. Best investment we've made."

> "I calculated it once: the time I save is worth $8,000 per month to my business. And I'm paying $47. It's not even close."

> "Friday afternoons used to be my least favorite time of the week. Now I actually have my weekends back."

**Action:**
Listen for emotion + specifics. Those are your quotes.

---

### 11. Don't Lead the Witness

**Leading questions get you the answer you want—not the truth.**

**Leading (bad):**
- "Don't you think [feature] is useful?"
- "I bet you love [feature], right?"
- "Wouldn't it be great if we built [feature]?"

**Open-ended (good):**
- "How do you use [feature]?"
- "What's your favorite part of [product]?"
- "If you could change one thing, what would it be?"

**Why it matters:**
Leading questions get you fake validation. Open questions get you real insights.

**Action:**
Review your questions. Remove "don't you think" and "wouldn't it be great."

---

### 12. Embrace Silence

**Silence is uncomfortable. But it's powerful.**

**What happens when you wait:**
1. You ask a question
2. They give a surface answer
3. You say nothing
4. They feel the need to fill the silence
5. **They give you the real answer**

**Example:**

**You:** "What almost made you not sign up?"  
**Them:** "I don't know, nothing really."  
**You:** [silence]  
**Them:** "Well... actually, I was worried about the price. I'd tried other tools and they never worked, so spending $50/month felt risky."

**See?** The silence got you the real objection.

**Action:**
When they give a short answer, wait 3 seconds before asking the next question. Often, they'll keep talking.

---

### 13. Ask About Failure (Not Just Success)

**Customers who only talk about wins aren't being honest.**

**Ask about challenges:**
- "What's been hardest about using [product]?"
- "Is there anything that frustrates you?"
- "What almost made you cancel?"
- "What's missing that you need?"

**Why it matters:**
- You find product gaps
- You uncover objections to address
- You sound like you actually care (not just collecting testimonials)

**Action:**
Include 1-2 "What's not working?" questions in every interview.

---

## After the Interview

### 14. Send a Thank-You (Within 24 Hours)

**Why it matters:** Gratitude builds goodwill. You might need a follow-up later.

**Template:**
```
Subject: Thanks for your time today!

Hi [Name],

Thanks for the call earlier! I really appreciate you sharing your experience with [Product].

A few takeaways that stuck with me:
- [Insight 1]
- [Insight 2]
- [Insight 3]

I'll follow up in the next week with [next step: draft case study, testimonial request, etc.].

Thanks again!

[Your name]
```

**Action:**
Block 10 minutes after every interview to send this email.

---

### 15. Turn It Into Content (Don't Let It Die)

**The interview is useless if you don't act on it.**

**Within 1 week, create:**
- Case study (publish on website)
- Testimonial (add to homepage)
- LinkedIn post (share the win)
- Email to prospects (social proof)

**Within 1 month, create:**
- Blog post (long-form)
- FAQ section (from their questions)
- Sales one-pager (for proposals)

**Action:**
Block 2 hours after the interview to create content. Or use AI to speed it up (10 minutes instead of 2 hours).

---

## Bonus Tips

### Record Everything (Audio + Video)

**Tools:**
- Zoom (built-in recording)
- Otter.ai (transcription + recording)
- Riverside.fm (high-quality audio/video)

**Why:** You'll forget 90% of what was said. Recordings don't.

---

### Transcribe for Easy Reference

**Options:**
- Otter.ai ($17/month, high accuracy)
- Rev ($1.50/min, human transcription)
- AssemblyAI ($0.12/min, API)

**Why:** Searchable transcript = easier to pull quotes later.

---

### Create a Customer Interview Template

**Save time by reusing the same structure:**
```
CUSTOMER INTERVIEW TEMPLATE

Goal: [Case study / Feature validation / Pain point research]

Questions:
1. What problem were you trying to solve?
2. How were you handling [task] before?
3. Walk me through how you use [product].
4. What's changed since you started?
5. Can you quantify the impact?
6. What almost made you cancel?
7. If you could change one thing, what would it be?

Follow-ups:
- "Tell me more about that."
- "Can you be more specific?"
- "How did that make you feel?"
```

## Common Mistakes (And How to Avoid Them)

### Mistake 1: Interviewing Only Happy Customers

**Wrong:** Only talk to power users who love you.  
**Right:** Mix in new users, churned users, and struggling users.

**Why:** Happy customers give you testimonials. Struggling customers give you insights.

---

### Mistake 2: Asking Hypotheticals

**Wrong:** "If we built [feature], would you use it?"  
**Right:** "How are you currently solving [problem]?"

**Why:** People lie about what they'd do. Ask what they actually do.

---

### Mistake 3: Not Taking Notes

**Wrong:** "I'll remember the important stuff."  
**Right:** Record + transcribe + take notes.

**Why:** You won't remember. Ever.

---

### Mistake 4: Pitching Instead of Listening

**Wrong:** "Oh, we're building that! Let me tell you about it..."  
**Right:** "Interesting. Tell me more about why you need that."

**Why:** You're there to learn, not sell.

---

### Mistake 5: Letting It Sit Forever

**Wrong:** Interview → transcript → downloads folder → forgotten.  
**Right:** Interview → transcript → case study → published within 1 week.

**Why:** Content that's published > content that's perfect.
