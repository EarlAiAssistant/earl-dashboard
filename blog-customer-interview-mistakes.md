## Introduction: Why Most Customer Interviews Fail

You block off 30 minutes. You send the calendar invite. You show up prepared.

**Then this happens:**

- You ask vague questions → You get vague answers
- You talk too much → The customer talks too little
- You don't record it → You forget the best quotes
- You never publish anything → The insights die in your notes app

**The result?** Wasted time. Zero ROI. Frustrated customers who wonder why they bothered.

**But here's the good news:** Most interview mistakes are fixable with small tweaks.

This guide covers the **12 most common customer interview mistakes** — and exactly how to avoid them.

---

## Mistake #1: Not Having a Clear Goal

### **The Problem**

You schedule an interview without knowing **why** you're doing it.

**What happens:**
- You ask random questions
- The conversation meanders
- You end with no actionable insights

### **The Fix**

Before every interview, answer: **"What do I want to learn?"**

**Examples of clear goals:**
- ✅ "Get a quotable case study for the homepage"
- ✅ "Understand why customers churn after 30 days"
- ✅ "Learn which features drive the most value"
- ✅ "Find objections prospects have before buying"

**Pro tip:** Share the goal with the customer upfront:

> "Thanks for joining! The goal today is to understand how you use [Product] so we can write a case study. Sound good?"

This sets expectations and keeps the conversation focused.

---

## Mistake #2: Asking Yes/No Questions

### **The Problem**

**Bad question:**  
> "Do you like the product?"

**Customer response:**  
> "Yeah, it's good."

Conversation dead.

### **The Fix**

Ask **open-ended questions** that require stories, not one-word answers.

**Instead of:**  
> "Do you like the product?"

**Ask:**  
> "What's your favorite thing about the product?"

**Instead of:**  
> "Did this save you time?"

**Ask:**  
> "How much time would you say this saves you each week?"

**Pro tip:** Start questions with:
- "What..."
- "How..."
- "Tell me about..."
- "Walk me through..."

These force narrative answers.

---

## Mistake #3: Leading the Witness

### **The Problem**

**Bad question:**  
> "You love how fast it is, right?"

**Why it's bad:**  
You just put words in their mouth. They'll agree even if speed isn't the real reason they love it.

### **The Fix**

Let the customer choose the angle.

**Instead of:**  
> "You love the speed, right?"

**Ask:**  
> "What stands out to you most?"

Maybe they say speed. Maybe they say accuracy. Maybe they say something you didn't expect (like customer support or ease of use).

**Pro tip:** Resist the urge to finish their sentences. Let them land the plane.

---

## Mistake #4: Talking Too Much

### **The Problem**

**What it sounds like:**

> **You:** "So we built this feature because we were hearing from customers that... [5-minute monologue]... anyway, what do you think?"  
> **Customer:** "Uh, yeah, sounds good."

You just burned 5 minutes of a 30-minute call. And you learned nothing.

### **The Fix**

**80/20 rule:** The customer should talk 80% of the time. You talk 20%.

**Your job:**
- Ask good questions
- Listen
- Take notes
- Ask follow-up questions

**Not your job:**
- Explain your product roadmap
- Justify design decisions
- Sell them on features

**Pro tip:** After asking a question, **shut up.** Even if there's silence. Let them think.

---

## Mistake #5: Not Recording the Interview

### **The Problem**

You rely on memory. You scribble notes while they talk. You miss half of what they say.

**By the time you sit down to write the case study:**
- You forgot the best quotes
- You're fuzzy on the details
- You have to email them to clarify ("Wait, how much time did you save again?")

### **The Fix**

**Always record** (with permission).

**How to ask:**
> "I'd like to record this so I can focus on our conversation instead of taking notes. Is that okay?"

99% of people say yes.

**Tools:**
- **Zoom:** Built-in recording + auto-transcription
- **Otter.ai:** Real-time transcription
- **Fireflies.ai:** Joins calls automatically
- **Google Meet:** Built-in recording

**Pro tip:** After the call, scan the transcript for quotable moments. Highlight them and save them to a doc.

---

## Mistake #6: Skipping the "Before" Context

### **The Problem**

You jump straight to: "How's the product working?"

**Customer says:**  
> "Good, we're saving time."

**You have no idea:**
- How much time?
- Compared to what?
- What was broken before?

### **The Fix**

Always start with the **"Before"** question.

**Example:**
> "Before you found [Product], what did [process] look like? Walk me through a typical day."

**This gives you:**
- Context (what was broken)
- Contrast (before vs. after)
- Emotional stakes (how bad was it?)

**Pro tip:** The "Before" section is what makes case studies compelling. Without it, the "After" doesn't land.

---

## Mistake #7: Not Probing for Numbers

### **The Problem**

**You:** "Did this save you time?"  
**Them:** "Yeah, definitely."

**You just missed a chance to quantify it.**

"Saved time" is vague. "Saved 15 hours a week" is a headline.

### **The Fix**

**Always ask for numbers** — even rough estimates.

**Examples:**
> "How much time would you say this saves you? Even a ballpark guess is fine."

> "If you had to put a dollar value on that, what would it be?"

> "How many [tasks/leads/sales] did this help you generate?"

**If they don't know:**  
Give them options.

> "Would you say it's closer to 5 hours a week, 10 hours, or more like 20?"

Most people will pick one and refine it.

**Pro tip:** Numbers are proof. "Improved efficiency" means nothing. "40% faster" is a stat you can use.

---

## Mistake #8: Ignoring Negative Feedback

### **The Problem**

**Customer:** "Yeah, the product is great. Though there is one thing that's kind of annoying..."  
**You:** "Oh, we're working on that! Anyway, back to what you love—"

**You just shut down the most valuable part of the conversation.**

### **The Fix**

**Lean into the complaints.** Negative feedback reveals:
- Pain points you didn't know existed
- Feature requests
- Objections prospects have (use this in marketing)

**When they mention a complaint, ask:**
> "Tell me more about that. What makes it annoying?"

> "How often does that come up?"

> "If we fixed that, what would change for you?"

**Pro tip:** Complaints are goldmines for product development **and** marketing. If one customer complains, 50 others are thinking it.

---

## Mistake #9: Not Asking About Alternatives

### **The Problem**

You never ask: "What else did you try?"

**You miss:**
- Competitive intelligence (who are you really up against?)
- Differentiation angles (why did they pick you over X?)
- Objection handling (what made them hesitate?)

### **The Fix**

**Always ask about alternatives.**

**Examples:**
> "What were you using before this?"

> "Did you try any other tools? What didn't work about them?"

> "What made you choose us over [Competitor]?"

**Real example:**

**Question:** "What else did you look at before choosing Call-Content?"

**Response:**  
> "We tried Otter and Fireflies. Both transcribe well, but neither actually **writes** the content. I'd still have to spend hours turning the transcript into a case study. Call-Content was the only one that did the full thing."

**Why this is gold:**
- Names competitors (shows they did their homework)
- Explains why competitors fell short
- Highlights your unique value

**Pro tip:** Use this in marketing: "Unlike Otter and Fireflies, we don't just transcribe — we write the case study for you."

---

## Mistake #10: Interrupting

### **The Problem**

**Them:** "Yeah, so before we started using it—"  
**You:** "Oh, did you try [Competitor]?"

**You just cut off a potential gold nugget.**

### **The Fix**

**Shut up.**

**When they're on a roll:**
- Don't interrupt
- Don't finish their sentences
- Don't inject your thoughts

**Your job:** Take notes. Let them talk.

**Pro tip:** Use silence strategically. After asking a question, count to 5 in your head before speaking again. Most people will fill the silence with something valuable.

---

## Mistake #11: Not Capturing Emotion

### **The Problem**

You ask: "How's it working?"  
They say: "Good, no complaints."

**You just missed the emotional hook.**

### **The Fix**

Ask **feeling-based questions.**

**Examples:**
> "How did you **feel** when you first saw the results?"

> "Was there a moment where you thought, 'Oh wow, this actually works'?"

> "What was your reaction the first time you used it?"

**Real example:**

**Question:** "How did you feel when you realized this was saving you 10 hours a week?"

**Response:**  
> "Honestly? I almost cried. I'd been drowning in customer research for months, working nights and weekends just to keep up. When I saw the first draft, I thought, 'I can actually have my life back.'"

**Why this is powerful:**
- Emotional language ("almost cried," "drowning")
- Specific pain point (working nights/weekends)
- Clear before/after (drowning → life back)

**Pro tip:** Emotion sells. Prospects don't buy features — they buy relief, excitement, peace of mind.

## Mistake #12: Never Publishing Anything

### **The Problem**

You do the interview. You get great insights. You save the recording.

**Then... nothing.**

The content dies in your notes app. The customer wonders why you bothered. You wasted their time (and yours).

### **The Fix**

**Publish within 48 hours.**

**What to create:**
- Blog post (2,000 words, 30 min to write)
- Case study (1,500 words, 20 min to write)
- LinkedIn post (300 words, 5 min to write)
- Twitter thread (10 tweets, 10 min to write)
- Email newsletter blurb (200 words, 5 min to write)

**Pro tip:** Send the customer a link when it goes live. Most people love being featured. And they'll share it with their network.

---

## Bonus Mistake: Not Following Up

### **The Problem**

You publish the case study. You never tell the customer.

**They find it 6 months later and think:** "Why didn't they tell me?"

### **The Fix**

**Send a thank-you email immediately after publishing.**

**Template:**

> **Subject:** Thanks for the interview — here's the case study!
>
> Hey [Name],
>
> Thanks again for taking the time to chat last week! I just published the case study based on our conversation:
>
> [Link]
>
> If you spot anything you'd like me to tweak, just let me know. And feel free to share it with your network if you'd like!
>
> Appreciate you,  
> [Your Name]

**Why this matters:**
- Shows respect (you used their time wisely)
- Builds goodwill (they'll do another interview if you ask)
- Drives traffic (most customers will share it)
