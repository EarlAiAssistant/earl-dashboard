## Introduction

You finally got a customer to agree to an interview. You're excited — this is going to be a great case study!

You hop on the call, ask your questions, thank them for their time, and hang up feeling good.

Then you sit down to write the case study and realize: **you have nothing quotable.**

The interview was fine, but the answers were vague. Generic. Safe. Nothing you can really use.

**What went wrong?**

Chances are, you made one (or more) of the seven mistakes in this guide.

The good news: **they're all fixable.** And once you know what to avoid, your customer interviews will become goldmines of content, testimonials, and social proof.

---

## Mistake #1: Not Recording the Interview

### **The Problem**

You're frantically typing notes while the customer talks. You miss half of what they say because you're distracted. Later, you can't remember their exact words, so you paraphrase — and lose the magic.

**What you wanted:**
> "This saved me 20 hours a week. I can't believe I didn't do this sooner."

**What you wrote down:**
> "Customer said product saved time, was happy"

---

### **Why This Happens**

You think you'll remember. Or you're worried about making the customer uncomfortable by recording.

---

### **The Fix**

**Always record the interview.** Just ask permission first:

> "Hey, do you mind if I record this so I can focus on our conversation instead of taking notes? I'll send you a draft before publishing anything."

**99% of people say yes.**

**Tools:**
- **Zoom** (built-in cloud recording + auto-transcription)
- **Otter.ai** (free for 600 min/month)
- **Fireflies.ai** (free, auto-joins calls)
- **Call-Content** (built for customer interview content)

**Pro tip:** Tell them the recording is "so I don't miss any of your great insights." Frame it as respect for their time, not surveillance.

---

## Mistake #2: Asking Closed Questions

### **The Problem**

You ask questions that can be answered with "yes," "no," or one word.

**Bad question:** "Do you like the product?"  
**Customer answer:** "Yeah, it's good."

**Bad question:** "Did it save you time?"  
**Customer answer:** "Yes."

**Result:** No depth. No emotion. No quotable moments.

---

### **Why This Happens**

You're nervous. You want to make it easy for the customer. So you ask simple, safe questions.

---

### **The Fix**

**Ask open-ended questions that start with:**
- "How..."
- "What..."
- "Tell me about..."
- "Walk me through..."

**Good question:** "How has your workflow changed since you started using this?"  
**Customer answer:** "Oh man, it's night and day. I used to spend 10 hours a week on manual data entry. Now it's automated. I literally got 10 hours of my life back every week."

**See the difference?**

---

### **Examples: Closed vs. Open**

| ❌ Closed Question | ✅ Open Question |
|-------------------|-----------------|
| "Did it work for you?" | "What changed for you after you started using this?" |
| "Do you like the dashboard?" | "Walk me through how you use the dashboard in a typical day." |
| "Would you recommend us?" | "If a friend asked you about this, what would you tell them?" |
| "Was setup easy?" | "Tell me about your first week using the product — what surprised you?" |

---

## Mistake #3: Not Digging Deeper

### **The Problem**

The customer gives you a surface-level answer, and you immediately move to the next question.

**Example:**

**You:** "How has this helped you?"  
**Customer:** "It made things easier."  
**You:** "Great! So, what features do you use most?"

**You just missed the good stuff.**

---

### **Why This Happens**

You have a list of questions to get through, so you treat it like a checklist instead of a conversation.

---

### **The Fix**

**When someone says something interesting, don't move on. Dig deeper.**

Use these follow-up prompts:
- "Tell me more about that."
- "Can you give me a specific example?"
- "What do you mean by 'easier'?"
- "What happened next?"
- "How did that make you feel?"

**Example:**

**You:** "How has this helped you?"  
**Customer:** "It made things easier."  
**You:** "Tell me more — what do you mean by easier?"  
**Customer:** "Well, I used to spend every Monday morning manually pulling reports. It would take me 3-4 hours. Now the reports generate automatically overnight. I just review them over coffee. It's like getting Monday mornings back."

**Now you have a quote.**

---

## Mistake #4: Talking Too Much

### **The Problem**

You spend more time explaining your product than listening to the customer's story.

**Example of what not to do:**

**You:** "So, our platform has this amazing feature where you can automate your workflows. It uses AI to predict what tasks you'll need next, and it integrates with over 50 tools. We built it because we saw that most solutions were too rigid, so we made ours super flexible. Anyway, what do you think?"

**Customer:** "Um, yeah, it's nice."

---

### **Why This Happens**

You're excited about your product. You want to explain why it's great. But **this is their story, not yours.**

---

### **The Fix**

**80/20 rule: The customer talks 80% of the time. You talk 20%.**

Your job is to:
- Ask great questions
- Listen
- Ask follow-ups
- Shut up

**Tip:** If you find yourself explaining a feature, stop. Turn it into a question:

Instead of: "Our dashboard is really intuitive..."  
Say: "How do you use the dashboard in your day-to-day work?"

---

## Mistake #5: Not Creating Space for Emotion

### **The Problem**

You stick to facts and features, so the customer does too.

**Example:**

**You:** "What results did you see?"  
**Customer:** "We increased efficiency by 30%."  
**You:** "That's great. What else?"

**What you got:** A metric.  
**What you missed:** How it felt to achieve that result.

---

### **Why This Happens**

You're focused on getting data for the case study. But **data alone isn't compelling. Emotion is.**

---

### **The Fix**

**Ask questions that tap into how they *felt*:**

- "How did that change things for you personally?"
- "What was going through your mind when you saw those results?"
- "What did you tell your team when this started working?"
- "What would've happened if you hadn't solved this problem?"

**Example:**

**You:** "You said you increased efficiency by 30%. How did that change things for you personally?"  
**Customer:** "Honestly, it saved my sanity. I was working 60-hour weeks and still falling behind. My wife told me, 'Something has to change.' When I saw that 30% improvement, I realized I could finally leave work at a reasonable hour. It sounds dramatic, but it probably saved my marriage."

**That's the quote.** And you wouldn't have gotten it if you'd stuck to metrics.

---

## Mistake #6: Skipping the Silence

### **The Problem**

The customer finishes answering, and you immediately ask the next question. You never give them space to think.

---

### **Why This Happens**

Silence feels awkward. You want to fill it.

---

### **The Fix**

**After the customer finishes answering, count to 3 in your head before asking the next question.**

**Here's what happens:**

1. Customer gives an answer
2. You stay silent
3. Customer thinks, "Did I answer that fully?"
4. Customer keeps talking — and this is often where the best stuff comes out

**Example:**

**You:** "What was the biggest challenge you were facing?"  
**Customer:** "We were spending too much time on manual tasks."  
**You:** [Silence — count to 3]  
**Customer:** "Actually, it was worse than that. I'd stay up until midnight trying to catch up. One night, my kid asked me, 'Why are you always on your computer?' That's when I knew I had to find a better way."

**The silence gave them space to go deeper.**

---

## Mistake #7: Not Asking for Specifics

### **The Problem**

The customer gives you vague, generic answers, and you accept them.

**Example:**

**You:** "How much time did this save you?"  
**Customer:** "A lot."  
**You:** "Great!"

**What you got:** Nothing usable.  
**What you needed:** A specific number.

---

### **Why This Happens**

You don't want to seem pushy. You're grateful they're giving you their time, so you don't want to push for more.

---

### **The Fix**

**Politely press for specifics:**

- "When you say 'a lot,' can you ballpark it? 5 hours? 10 hours?"
- "Can you give me an example of when that happened?"
- "What does 'better' mean for you — faster? Cheaper? Easier?"

**Example:**

**You:** "You mentioned this saved you time. How much time are we talking?"  
**Customer:** "Oh, probably a lot."  
**You:** "Can you ballpark it? Like, 5 hours a week? 10?"  
**Customer:** "At least 15. Maybe 20 if you count all the little stuff."  
**You:** "Wow. What are you doing with those 15-20 hours now?"  
**Customer:** "Honestly? I'm spending time with my family instead of working late every night."

**Now you have:**
- A specific number (15-20 hours/week)
- An emotional payoff (family time)

---

## Bonus Mistake: Not Getting Permission to Publish

### **The Problem**

You write up the case study, publish it with the customer's name and company, and then get an angry email: "You didn't ask if you could use my name!"

---

### **The Fix**

**Always get permission before publishing.**

**At the end of the interview, say:**

> "Thanks so much for this! I'm going to write up your story and send you a draft before we publish anything. If there's anything you want me to change or remove, just let me know."

Then, **send them the draft** and get written approval (email is fine):

> "Hey [Name], here's the case study draft. Does this look good to you? Let me know if you'd like me to change anything!"

**Why this matters:**
- **Legal protection:** You have proof they approved it
- **Builds trust:** They feel respected
- **They might share it:** If they approve it, they're more likely to promote it

## How to Rescue a Bad Interview

What if you're already halfway through an interview and realize you're making these mistakes?

**Don't panic. You can course-correct.**

---

### **If the answers are too vague:**

**Say:** "That's helpful — can you give me a specific example of when that happened?"

---

### **If the customer is giving short answers:**

**Say:** "I'm curious — can you tell me the story of how you got here? Like, what was the moment you decided you needed to change something?"

---

### **If you're talking too much:**

**Say:** "Actually, I want to hear more from you. Tell me more about [topic]."

---

### **If you forgot to record:**

**Say:** "Hey, this conversation is so valuable — do you mind if I start recording from here? I want to make sure I capture your exact words."

## Real Example: Bad Interview → Good Interview

Let's see these principles in action.

---

### **❌ Bad Interview (Making All the Mistakes)**

**You:** "Did you like our product?"  
**Customer:** "Yeah, it's good."

**You:** "Did it save you time?"  
**Customer:** "Yes."

**You:** "Would you recommend us?"  
**Customer:** "Sure."

**You:** "Great! Thanks for your time."

**Result:** Nothing usable. Boring. Generic.

---

### **✅ Good Interview (Applying the Fixes)**

**You:** "What was your situation like before you found us?"  
**Customer:** "Oh man, it was rough. I was spending 20 hours a week on manual data entry. It was soul-crushing work, and I knew I was wasting time, but I didn't have a better option."

**You:** [Silence — count to 3]  
**Customer:** "Actually, it was worse than just time. I was making mistakes because I was so burned out. We had a client complain because I messed up their invoice. That was my wake-up call."

**You:** "What happened after that?"  
**Customer:** "I started looking for solutions. Found your tool. Set it up over a weekend. By Monday, the data entry was automated."

**You:** "How did that change things for you?"  
**Customer:** "I got my life back. I went from working 60-hour weeks to 40. I started leaving work at 5:30 instead of 9 PM. My wife actually noticed — she said, 'You seem happier.'"

**You:** "If you could go back and talk to yourself before you found this, what would you say?"  
**Customer:** "I'd say, 'Stop trying to do everything manually. You're burning yourself out for no reason. Just automate it and move on.'"

**Result:**
- Multiple quotable moments
- Specific numbers (20 hours/week, 60 → 40 hours)
- Emotion (soul-crushing, wake-up call, "You seem happier")
- Advice for others
